The approach targets scenarios involving both signal-plus-noise and signal-plus-interference-plus-noise mixtures, including sinusoidal interferers, LFM chirps, QPSK interferers with different sampling rates, and modulated interference such as QAM. The U-Net architecture leverages multiscale feature extraction and skip connections to preserve fine-grained temporal structure while suppressing interference components. Performance is evaluated using bit error rate and compared against conventional cancellation methods. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional techniques in low- and mid-SIR regimes, while remaining competitive at high SIRs. Additional experiments examine the autoencoder's behavior under model mismatch conditions such as carrier offset and colored noise. The study demonstrates that multiscale neural architectures provide a flexible and effective platform for interference mitigation across a wide range of interference types."}

A unified analysis framework is introduced that decomposes timing paths into logic, routing, and clocking components and maps them to well-defined pipeline stage transitions. This approach enables systematic comparison of timing behavior across heterogeneous implementation technologies at a microarchitectural level. Using static timing analysis and statistical characterization, the study shows that although both implementations exhibit dominant critical paths in the EX to MEM pipeline transition, their underlying timing mechanisms differ fundamentally. FPGA timing is dominated by routing parasitics and placement dependent variability, resulting in wide slack distributions and sensitivity to routing topology. In contrast, ASIC timing is governed primarily by combinational logic depth and predictable parametric variation across process, voltage, and temperature corners, yielding narrow and stable timing distributions. The results provide quantitative insight into the structural origins of timing divergence between programmable and custom fabrics and demonstrate the effectiveness of pipeline stage resolved analysis for identifying platform specific bottlenecks. Based on these findings, the paper derives design implications for achieving predictable timing closure in processor architectures targeting both FPGA and ASIC implementations."}

This is the authors' accepted manuscript version", "summary": "In this paper, we address the challenge of dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) network where a secondary user (SU) operates under both energy constraints and adversarial interference from a smart jammer. The SU coexists with primary users (PUs) and must ensure that its transmissions do not exceed a predefined interference threshold on licensed channels. At each time slot, the SU must jointly determine whether to transmit or harvest energy, which channel to access, and the appropriate transmit power while satisfying energy and interference constraints. Meanwhile, a smart jammer actively selects a channel to disrupt, aiming to degrade the SU's communication performance. This setting presents a significant challenge due to its multi-level decision structure and hybrid action space, which combines both discrete and continuous decisions. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (H-DDPG) framework that decomposes the decision-making process into three levels: the high-level policy determines the mode (transmit or harvest), the mid-level policy selects the channel, and the low-level actor outputs a continuous power level. Concurrently, the jammer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent that learns an adaptive channel jamming strategy using a discrete variant of DDPG. Simulation results show that our H-DDPG approach outperforms conventional flat reinforcement learning baselines."}

The conventional method in AE imaging is to transmit focused ultrasound (FUS) beams; however, the depth-of-field (DOF) of FUS-AE is limited to the size of the focal spot, which does not span across the centimeter-scale of organs. Instead of fixing the focal depth on transmission, we propose to dynamically synthesize the AE modulation regions via a Synthetic Aperture approach (SA-AE). SA-AE involves a straightforward pixel-based delay-and-sum reconstruction of AE images from unfocused AE signals. In saline and ex vivo lobster nerve experiments, FUS-AE was shown to perform well only at the focal depth, with poor spatial resolution for out-of-focus electric sources. Meanwhile, SA-AE generally improved spatial resolution throughout the DOF, but introduced strong background noise. The flexibility of uncoupled, single-element induced AE signals in SA-AE was further leveraged to quantify their spatial coherence across the transmit aperture, obtaining maps of the coherence factor (CF) and pulse-length coherence factor (CFPL). Weighting SA-AE images with their derived CF and CFPL maps resulted in further improvement in image resolution and contrast, and notably, boosted the image SNR beyond that of FUS-AE. CFPL exhibited stronger noise suppression over CF. Using unfocused wave transmissions, the proposed coherence-weighted SA-AE strategy offers a high resolution yet noise-robust solution towards the practical imaging of fast biological currents."}

Traditional NRR methods, while theoretically robust, often require extensive parameter tuning and incur high computational costs, limiting their use in real-time clinical workflows. Recent deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise; however, their dependence on task-specific retraining restricts scalability and adaptability in practice. These limitations underscore the need for efficient, generalizable registration frameworks capable of handling heterogeneous imaging contexts.

However, conventional detection algorithms, such as linear equalizers and message passing (MP) methods, either suffer from noise enhancement or fail under complex doubly-selective channels, especially in the presence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we propose a hybrid low-complexity iterative detection framework that combines linear minimum mean square error (L-MMSE) estimation with MP-based probabilistic inference. The key idea is to apply a new delay-Doppler (DD) commutation precoder (DDCP) to the DD domain signal vector, such that the resulting effective channel matrix exhibits a structured form with several locally dense blocks that are sparsely inter-connected. This precoding structure enables a hybrid iterative detection strategy, where a low-dimensional L-MMSE estimation is applied to the dense blocks, while MP is utilized to exploit the sparse inter-block connections. Furthermore, we provide a detailed complexity analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme incurs lower computational cost compared to the full-size L-MMSE detection. The simulation results of convergence performance confirm that the proposed hybrid MP detection achieves fast and reliable convergence with controlled complexity. In terms of error performance, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves significantly better bit error rate (BER) under various channel conditions. Particularly in multipath scenarios, the BER performance of the proposed method closely approaches the matched filter bound (MFB), indicating its near-optimal error performance."}

During surgery, microscopic clusters of disease are intraoperatively difficult to visualize and are often left behind, significantly increasing the risk of cancer recurrence. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has shown the ability to selectively tag cancer cells with gamma (γ) photon emitting radioisotopes to identify them, but require a mm-scale γ photon spectrometer to localize the position of these cells in the tissue margin (i.e., a function of incident γ photon energy) with high specificity. Here we present a 9.9 mm2 integrated circuit (IC)-based γ spectrometer implemented in 180 nm CMOS, to enable the measurement of single γ photons and their incident energy with sub-keV energy resolution. We use small 2 2 um reverse-biased diodes that have low depletion region capacitance, and therefore produce millivolt-scale voltage signals in response to the small charge generated by incident γ photons. A low-power energy spectrometry method is implemented by measuring the decay time it takes for the generated voltage signal to settle back to DC after a γ detection event, instead of measuring the voltage drop directly. This spectrometry method is implemented in three different pixel architectures that allow for configurable pixel sensitivity, energy-resolution, and energy dynamic range based on the widely heterogenous surgical and patient presentation in RGS. The spectrometer was tested with three common γ-emitting radioisotopes (64Cu, 133Ba, 177Lu), and is able to resolve activities down to 1 uCi with sub-keV energy resolution and 1.315 MeV energy dynamic range, using 5-minute acquisitions."}

This paper investigates a downlink multi-user multi-antenna system, and tackles the above challenges by introducing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission. Specifically, OTFS enables stable characterization of time-varying channels by representing them in the delay-Doppler domain. However, realistic propagation introduces various inter-symbol and inter-user interference due to non-orthogonal yet practical rectangular pulse shaping, fractional delays, Doppler shifts, and imperfect (statistical) CSIT. In this context, RSMA offers promising robustness for interference mitigation and CSIT imperfections, and hence is integrated with OTFS to provide a comprehensive solution. A compact cross-domain input-output relationship for RSMA-OTFS is established, and an ergodic sum-rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a weighted minimum mean-square-error based alternating optimization algorithm that does not depend on channel sparsity. Simulation results reveal that the considered practical propagation effects significantly degrade performance if unaddressed.

Two main beam layout solutions are proposed to significantly reduce the number of beams required to illuminate the coverage area: one based on phased array beams with low beam crossover levels and the other on widened beams. A numerical evaluation using practical system parameters showed that both solutions perform similarly, but that the best result is obtained with phased arrays beams with optimized beam cross over levels. Indeed, for the system evaluated, they allowed reducing the total number of beams from 1723 to 451, which combined with a proper beam hopping pattern and scheduling scheme allowed obtaining a coverage ratio of 100% and a common signaling efficiency (i.e. number of slots carrying common signaling over total number of slots) up to 80.6% for the most stringent common signaling periodicity of 20 ms considered by 3GPP."}

However, the inherently high free-space path loss of THz waves significantly limits the coverage range of THz communication systems. Therefore, extending the effective coverage area is a key challenge for the practical deployment of THz networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation, provide a solution to enhance THz coverage. To investigate multi-RIS deployment scenarios, this work integrates an antenna array-based RIS model into the ray-tracing simulation platform. Using an indoor hall as a representative case study, the enhancement effects of single-hop and dual-hop RIS configurations on indoor signal coverage are evaluated under various deployment schemes. The developed framework offers valuable insights and design references for optimizing RIS-assisted indoor THz communication and coverage estimation."}

In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data."}

To address this challenge, we propose a strategy that enables a \"double use\" of UAVs, unifying the monitoring and relay handoff functions into a single, efficient process. Our scheme, guided by an integrated sensing and communication framework, coordinates these multi-role UAVs through a proactive handoff network that fuses multi-view sensory data from aerial and ground vehicles. A lightweight vehicle inspection module and a two-stage training procedure are developed to ensure monitoring accuracy and collaborative efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach: it reduces communication outage probability by nearly 10% at a 200 Mbps requirement without compromising monitoring performance and maintains high resilience (86% achievable rate) even in the absence of multiple UAVs, outperforming traditional ground-based handoff schemes.

This arXiv version is the authors' accepted manuscript", "summary": "This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions."}

Real-world experiments at the NSF AERPAW testbed demonstrate that radar and RF sensing provide complementary strengths under varying geometric, range, and line-of-sight conditions. A Kalman filter using a constant-velocity motion model integrates the asynchronous 2D RF and 3D radar observations, suppressing large standalone errors, improving accuracy over individual modalities, and increasing tracking coverage without degrading performance.

Delay--Doppler (DD)-domain ISAC offers a more robust foundation under high mobility, but it requires a suitable DD-domain pulse-shaping filter. The prevailing DD pulse designs are either communication-centric or static, which limits adaptation to non-stationary channels and diverse application demands. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the tunable Gaussian pulse (TGP), a DD-native, analytically tunable pulse shape parameterized by its aspect ratio \\( γ\\), chirp rate \\( α_c \\), and phase coupling \\( β_c \\). On the sensing side, we derive closed-form Cramér--Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) that map \\( (γ,α_c,β_c) \\) to fundamental delay and Doppler precision. On the communications side, we show that \\( α_c \\) and \\( β_c \\) reshape off-diagonal covariance, and thus inter-symbol interference (ISI), without changing received power, isolating capacity effects to interference structure rather than power loss. A comprehensive trade-off analysis demonstrates that the TGP spans a flexible operational region from the high capacity of the Sinc pulse to the high precision of the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse. Notably, TGP attains near-RRC sensing precision while retaining over \\( 90\\% \\) of Sinc's maximum capacity, achieving a balanced operating region that is not attainable by conventional static pulse designs."}

The conventional method in AE imaging is to transmit focused ultrasound (FUS) beams; however, the depth-of-field (DOF) of FUS-AE is limited to the size of the focal spot, which does not span across the centimeter-scale of organs. Instead of fixing the focal depth on transmission, we propose to dynamically synthesize the AE modulation regions via a Synthetic Aperture approach (SA-AE). SA-AE involves a straightforward pixel-based delay-and-sum reconstruction of AE images from unfocused AE signals. In saline and ex vivo lobster nerve experiments, FUS-AE was shown to perform well only at the focal depth, with poor spatial resolution for out-of-focus electric sources. Meanwhile, SA-AE generally improved spatial resolution throughout the DOF, but introduced strong background noise. The flexibility of uncoupled, single-element induced AE signals in SA-AE was further leveraged to quantify their spatial coherence across the transmit aperture, obtaining maps of the coherence factor (CF) and pulse-length coherence factor (CFPL). Weighting SA-AE images with their derived CF and CFPL maps resulted in further improvement in image resolution and contrast, and notably, boosted the image SNR beyond that of FUS-AE. CFPL exhibited stronger noise suppression over CF. Using unfocused wave transmissions, the proposed coherence-weighted SA-AE strategy offers a high resolution yet noise-robust solution towards the practical imaging of fast biological currents."}

During surgery, microscopic clusters of disease are intraoperatively difficult to visualize and are often left behind, significantly increasing the risk of cancer recurrence. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has shown the ability to selectively tag cancer cells with gamma (γ) photon emitting radioisotopes to identify them, but require a mm-scale γ photon spectrometer to localize the position of these cells in the tissue margin (i.e., a function of incident γ photon energy) with high specificity. Here we present a 9.9 mm2 integrated circuit (IC)-based γ spectrometer implemented in 180 nm CMOS, to enable the measurement of single γ photons and their incident energy with sub-keV energy resolution. We use small 2 2 um reverse-biased diodes that have low depletion region capacitance, and therefore produce millivolt-scale voltage signals in response to the small charge generated by incident γ photons. A low-power energy spectrometry method is implemented by measuring the decay time it takes for the generated voltage signal to settle back to DC after a γ detection event, instead of measuring the voltage drop directly. This spectrometry method is implemented in three different pixel architectures that allow for configurable pixel sensitivity, energy-resolution, and energy dynamic range based on the widely heterogenous surgical and patient presentation in RGS. The spectrometer was tested with three common γ-emitting radioisotopes (64Cu, 133Ba, 177Lu), and is able to resolve activities down to 1 uCi with sub-keV energy resolution and 1.315 MeV energy dynamic range, using 5-minute acquisitions."}
