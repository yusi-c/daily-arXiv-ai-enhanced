Recent advances in fine-tuning\nmechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless\nnetworks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices\npose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these\nissues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless\nnetworks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated\nfine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA\nmodules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly\nmitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability.\nSecond, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on\ntheoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a\nnon-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and\ndecouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth\nallocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve\nthe problems with polynomial computational complexity.

While adding more elements can narrow beamwidth and suppress\ninterference, such scaling incurs prohibitive hardware and power costs.\nRotatable antennas (RAs), which allow mechanical or electronic adjustment of\nelement orientations, introduce a new degree of freedom to exploit spatial\nflexibility without enlarging the array. By dynamically optimizing\norientations, RAs can substantially improve desired link alignment and\ninterference suppression. This paper investigates RA-enabled multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) interference channels under co-channel spectrum sharing\nand formulates a weighted sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes\ntransmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this nonconvex\nproblem, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) framework that integrates\nweighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based beamforming with\nFrank-Wolfe-based orientation updates. To reduce complexity, we further study\norientation optimization under maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and\nzero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes. For finite-resolution actuators, we\nconstruct spherical Fibonacci codebooks and design a cross-entropy method\n(CEM)-based algorithm for discrete orientation selection. Simulations show that\nintegrating RAs with conventional beamforming markedly increases weighted\nsum-rate, with gains rising with element directivity. Under discrete\norientation control, the proposed CEM algorithm consistently outperforms the\nnearest-projection baseline."}

Classical coherent receivers are widely employed in coherent\nstates based CV-QKD protocols, whose detection performance is bounded by the\nstandard quantum limit (SQL). Recently, quantum receivers based on displacement\noperators are experimentally demonstrated with detection performance\noutperforming the SQL in various practical conditions. However, potential\napplications of quantum receivers in CV-QKD protocols under turbulent channels\nare still not well explored, while practical CV-QKD protocols must survive from\nthe atmospheric turbulence in satellite-to-ground optical communication links.\nIn this paper, we consider the possibility of using a quantum receiver called\nmulti-stage CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the SKR performance of a quadrature\nphase shift keying (QPSK) modulated CV-QKD protocol in turbulent channels. We\nfirst derive the error probability of the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver for\ndetecting QPSK signals in turbulent channels and further propose three types of\nmulti-stage CD-Kennedy receiver with different displacement choices, i.e., the\nType-I, Type-II, and Type-III receivers. Then we derive the SKR of a QPSK\nmodulated CV-QKD protocol using the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver and\npost-selection strategy in turbulent channels. Numerical results show that the\nmulti-stage CD-Kennedy receiver can outperform the classical coherent receiver\nin turbulent channels in terms of both error probability and SKR performance\nand the Type-II receiver can tolerate worse channel conditions compared with\nType-I and Type-III receivers in terms of error probability performance."}

Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track\nthe reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance\nraised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported\ninfection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories\nsimultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances\nboth the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates.

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) extends this concept by\nenabling the detection and localization of acoustic sources along the fiber,\nusing backscattered light from small segments to achieve spatial resolution on\nthe order of meters. Recently, DAS has also been explored as a component in\nunderwater acoustic communication systems. Emerging interest in bidirectional\nconfigurations where both transmitter and receiver are placed at opposite ends\nof the fiber has opened new possibilities. However, in such setups, source\nlocalization is not inherently integrated into the signal decoding process. For\nscenarios where source positioning is valuable, we propose an approach inspired\nby bi-static radar principles. This configuration utilizes acoustic signals\nreceived at both ends of the fiber to estimate source position based on\npropagation delay differences. Although the localization accuracy is lower than\nthat of DAS due to reduced sampling rates, the method offers a viable\nalternative for integrated communication and positioning. We present the system\ntopology and configuration for a dual-fiber layout, each end equipped with\noptical transmitters and receivers. The position estimation is derived from the\ntime difference of arrival (TDOA) between the two receivers. The Cram\\'er-Rao\nBound is derived to characterize the theoretical limits of localization\naccuracy, highlighting dependencies on system parameters such as optical power\nloss. Our analysis shows that increased acoustic bandwidth and higher carrier\nfrequencies enhance spatial resolution.

Although\nextensive research has been conducted on accurate radio map construction, most\nexisting approaches assume noise-free location information during sensing. In\npractice, however, positioning errors ranging from a few to several tens of\nmeters can arise due to device-based positioning systems (e.g., GNSS).
