To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nview-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from\na single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range,\nresolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer\nto preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for\nstable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over\nviewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for\nclinical applications but also for medical education and data extension,\nenabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and\nanalysis. Our code is available at GitHub."}

With the ever-increasing demand for high\ndata rates and system scalability, the fronthaul load becomes a critical\nbottleneck. Our method uses O-RAN compression techniques to efficiently\ncompress the fronthaul signals. The goal is to greatly lower the fronthaul load\nwhile having little effect on the overall system performance, as shown by Block\nError Rate (BLER) curves. Through rigorous link-level simulations, we compare\nour quantization strategies against a benchmark scenario with no quantization,\nproviding insights into the trade-offs between fronthaul data rate reduction\nand link performance integrity. The results demonstrate that our proposed\nquantization techniques not only lower the fronthaul load but also maintain a\ncompetitive link quality, making them a viable solution for enhancing the\nefficiency of next-generation wireless networks. This study underscores the\npotential of quantization in O-RAN contexts to achieve optimal balance between\nsystem capacity and performance, paving the way for more scalable and robust\nDD-MIMO deployments."}

Automatic methods, especially data-driven\nmethods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,\nwhich is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an\nunsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection\nthrough self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from\n4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for\nmanual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric\nmeasurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable\nspatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the\napproach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2\nframes (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised\nmethods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust\nperformance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for\nES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized\nheart views due to fetal heart positioning variability. Our results demonstrate\nthe potential of the proposed latent motion trajectory strategy for cardiac\nphase detection in adult and fetal echocardiography. This work advances\nunsupervised cardiac motion analysis, offering a scalable solution for clinical\npopulations lacking annotated data.

In\nclinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the\nscreening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist\nis a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this\narea remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality\ninstance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with\nnarrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring\ndetailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression\nin RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,\nwhich alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating\nexpertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist\nbone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)\nSharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for\nwrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional\nradiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level\ninstance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548\nimages. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks\nrelated to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression\nquantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte\ndetection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal\nbone fracture localization.

To address this, recent work has explored deep\nlearning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an\nend-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware\nSpatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our\narchitecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear\ncomplexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba\nachieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping,\nit reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further\ndemonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies\nconfirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module\nbeing particularly important under strong undersampling. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust\nreconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable\nalternative to traditional DM-based methods."}
