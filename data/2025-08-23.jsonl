To investigate their capabilities, we\nstudy the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer\nstudies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing\nalternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and\nSIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches\nsuffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,\nwhen the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \\emph{fixed SIM\nthickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains\ncan still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed\nmethod in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design\nguidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase\nshifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first\nyields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB\nfirst; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are\ngradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their\nscalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better\nperformance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing\nsolutions.

However, their\nperformance often declines when applied to data from different domains,\nprimarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between\nsource and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable\ndeployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present\nDoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch\nnormalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain\ngeneralization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale\nfull-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly\nintroduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a\nsystematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nOur results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain\ndependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the\nsame domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain\nshift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully\nconnected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We\nfurther integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,\nyielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can\nbe readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse\nclinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and\ngeneralizable mammography classification systems."}

Ensuring the physical property of the\ndenoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep\nunfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a\nphysical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks\nconvergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the\nhidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and\nmodels them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the\noptimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium\nConvolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local\nspatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global\nspatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse\ncoding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse\nrepresentation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while\nunshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral\ndetails. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is\nembedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is\nintegrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate\nthe proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and\ntransform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within\nthe framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method\nachieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Alexandre", "Luís C. Freire"], "title": "Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?", "comment": "10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that\nprovides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy\nsubtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the\nemergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial\ngeneration of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such\ntechniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,\npotentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy\nimage acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the\nartificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a\nU-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a\nseries of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the\nclassification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant\ncategories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of\nvirtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that\nthe best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an\nF1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with\nthe real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional\ndiagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher\nclassification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image\ngeneration is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance\ngap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes\nclinically viable."}

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results\nsuggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly\nleveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI\nin medical imaging."}

Currently, annotation is primarily performed\nthrough manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,\nwhich often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful\ntools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on\nwell-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly\navailable MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.\n  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight\nneural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex\nstructures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is\na Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on\nthe CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural\nnetworks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset\nreaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually\nannotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset\n(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the\nsupervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides\nhigh accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the\nmost complex important cases.
