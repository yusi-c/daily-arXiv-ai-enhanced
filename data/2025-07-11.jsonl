Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network\nsolving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as\na single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different\ncancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers\nin terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,\nwe propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific\nprompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared\nknowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early\nintroduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to\nadaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset\nwith four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.\nFinally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax\nfor breast cancer survival analysis.

X-ray image\nsegmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,\nyet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior\nperformance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large\namount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an\nannotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of\nexpertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in\nX-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.\nTo overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of\nsimulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with\ntheir corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for\nwrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated\nusing both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores\nranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different\nview angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray\nimages also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The\ntrained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research\npurposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance."}

To address\nthe problem, we propose a novel TOC method with two models: a static and a\ndynamic model. In the static model, we apply a neural network (NN) as a\ntask-oriented encoder (TOE) when there is no computation budget constraint. The\ndynamic model is used when device computation resources are limited, and it\nuses dynamic NNs with multiple exits as the TOE. The dynamic model sorts input\ndata by complexity with thresholds, allowing the efficient allocation of\ncomputation resources. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of the proposed\nTOC methods and show that the model converges at rate\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)$ with an epoch of length $T$.

The\ninterference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry\ninformation about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage\nof the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the\nspeckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns\ntypically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster\nscanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the\nnumber of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging\nframework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements\nare taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's\ncapabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques.

We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these\nfields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow\ncurrents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is\nquantified across edges.
