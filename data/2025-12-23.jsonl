Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications."}

We develop a deep-learning surrogate for a three-dimensional duct MC channel with reactive diffusion-advection transport and reversible ligand-receptor binding on a finite ring receiver. Using a physics-based partial differential equation (PDE)-ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we generate a large CIR dataset across broad transport, reaction, and geometric ranges and train a neural network that maps these parameters directly to the CIR. On an independent test set, the surrogate closely matches reference CIRs both qualitatively and quantitatively: the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) shows that 90% of test channels are predicted with error below 0.15, with only weak dependence on individual parameters. The surrogate therefore offers an accurate and computationally efficient replacement for repeated PDE-based CIR evaluations in MC system analysis and design."}

For baseband beamforming, the lossy case yields an second-order cone programming-based solution, while the lossless case admits a closed-form solution via maximum ratio transmission. The PAs' positions in both cases are optimized through the Gauss-Seidel-based method.

However, the training frameworks of image compression still focus on the vision of human, maintaining the excessive perceptual details, thus have limitations in optimally reducing the bits per pixel in the case of performing machine vision tasks. In this paper, we propose Semantic-based Low-bitrate Image compression for Machines by leveraging diffusion, termed SLIM. This is a new effective training framework of image compression for machine vision, using a pretrained latent diffusion model.The compressor model of our method focuses only on the Region-of-Interest (RoI) areas for machine vision in the image latent, to compress it compactly. Then the pretrained Unet model enhances the decompressed latent, utilizing a RoI-focused text caption which containing semantic information of the image. Therefore, SLIM is able to focus on RoI areas of the image without any guide mask at the inference stage, achieving low bitrate when compressing. And SLIM is also able to enhance a decompressed latent by denoising steps, so the final reconstructed image from the enhanced latent can be optimized for the machine vision task while still containing perceptual details for human vision. Experimental results show that SLIM achieves a higher classification accuracy in the same bits per pixel condition, compared to conventional image compression models for machines.Code will be released upon acceptance."}

We therefore propose a user positioning and monitoring system that infers locations from spatial intensity measurements on a photodetector (PD) array. Specifically, our hybrid approach couples an optics-informed forward model and sparse, model-based inversion with a lightweight data-driven calibration stage, yielding high accuracy at low computational cost. This design preserves the interpretability and stability of model-based reconstruction while leveraging learning to absorb residual nonidealities and device-specific distortions. Under identical hardware and training conditions (both with 5 x 10^5 samples), the hybrid method attains consistently lower mean-squared error than a generic deep-learning baseline while using substantially less training time and compute. Accuracy improves with array resolution and saturates around 60 x 60-80 x 80, indicating a favorable accuracy-complexity trade-off for real-time deployment. The resulting position estimates can be cross-checked with real-time network logs to enable continuous monitoring, anomaly detection (e.g., potential eavesdropping), and access control in outdoor optical access networks."}

A system and channel model is developed including turbulence, misalignment, and safe-zone effects, and information theoretic metrics are derived to evaluate security. Simulation results show that the safe zone significantly reduces information leakage and that careful tuning of beam waist, angular threshold, and aperture size is essential for maximizing the secret key rate. Larger apertures improve performance but increase receiver size, while longer links require sub 100 urad alignment accuracy.

Amplitude-phase-time block modulation (APTBM) has recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem. By leveraging the intrinsic amplitude and phase constraints of each APTBM block, PA-induced nonlinear distortion can be mitigated through constraint-guided signal reconstruction. However, existing reconstruction methods apply these constraints only heuristically and statistically, limiting the achievable IBO reduction and PA efficiency improvement. This paper addresses this limitation by decomposing the nonlinear distortion into dominant and residual components, and accordingly develops a novel two-stage signal reconstruction algorithm consisting of coarse and fine reconstruction stages. The coarse reconstruction stage eliminates the dominant distortion by jointly exploiting the APTBM block structure and PA nonlinear characteristics. The fine reconstruction stage minimizes the residual distortion by formulating a nonconvex optimization problem that explicitly enforces the APTBM constraints. To handle this problem efficiently, a low-complexity iterative variable substitution method is introduced, which relaxes the problem into a sequence of trust-region subproblems, each solvable in closed form. The proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and testbed experiments. Results show that it achieves up to 4 dB IBO reduction in simulations and up to 2 dB IBO reduction in experiments while maintaining transmission performance, corresponding to PA efficiency improvements of 59.1\\% and 33.9\\%, respectively, over existing methods."}

We employed the No New Net (nnU-Net) framework with a selective training strategy that systematically analyzed the impact of image quality and center-specific variability on segmentation performance.

With the growing density of satellites and terrestrial emitters, algorithms with faster convergence speed and better performance are needed. This work investigates RIS-equipped reflector antennas as a representative example of RIS-assisted spatial nulling and develop algorithms for sidelobe cancellation at specific directions and frequencies under various constraints.

For the discrete-phase case, we reformulate the problem using a penalty method and solve it via majorization-minimization, outperforming the heuristic methods from our earlier work. Further, we analyze the electric field characteristics across multiple interference directions and frequencies to quantify the nulling capability of the RIS-aided reflectors, and identify a simple criterion for the existence of unimodular weights enabling perfect nulls.

Coupled tensor decomposition (CTD)-based methods have gained traction in this domain, offering recoverability guarantees under various assumptions. Existing models such as canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and Tucker decomposition provide strong expressive power but lack physical interpretability. The block-term decomposition model with rank-$(L_r, L_r, 1)$ terms (the LL1 model) yields interpretable factors under the linear mixture model (LMM) of spectral images, but LMM assumptions are often violated in practice -- primarily due to nonlinear effects such as endmember variability (EV). To address this, we propose modeling spectral images using a more flexible block-term tensor decomposition with rank-$(L_r, M_r, N_r)$ terms (the LMN model). This modeling choice retains interpretability, subsumes CPD, Tucker, and LL1 as special cases, and robustly accounts for non-ideal effects such as EV, offering a balanced tradeoff between expressiveness and interpretability for HSR. Importantly, under the LMN model for HSI and MSI, recoverability of the SRI can still be established under proper conditions -- providing strong theoretical support. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with existing CTD-based approaches."}

Such scenarios arise frequently in applications such as passive radar, cognitive radio, low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) radar, and planetary radar for radio astronomy, where canceling the radio frequency interference (RFI) is critical for uncovering the SOI. In this work, we examine the Demodulation-Remodulation (Demod-Remod) based interference cancellation framework for the RFI. This approach demodulates the unknown interference, creates a noise-free interference replica, and coherently subtracts it from the received signal. To evaluate the performance limits, we employ the performance metric termed \\textit{interference rejection ratio} (IRR), which quantifies the interference canceled. We derive the analytical expressions of IRR as a function of the optimal estimation variances of the signal parameters. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expression for both single-carrier and multi-carrier interference signals and demonstrate that the method can substantially suppress the interference at a sufficient interference-to-noise ratio (INR), enabling enhanced detection and extraction of the SOI. We further extend the analysis to the scenario where the SOI is above the noise floor, and confirm the validity of the theoretical IRR expression in this scenario. Lastly, we compare the Demod-Remod technique to other time-domain cancellation methods. The result of the comparison identifies the conditions under which each method is preferred, offering practical guidelines for interference mitigation under different scenarios."}

However, its intrinsic characteristics also pose new security challenges, notably an increased vulnerability to eavesdropping attacks. Existing studies on defending against eavesdropping attacks in DeepJSCC, while demonstrating certain effectiveness, often incur considerable computational overhead or introduce performance trade-offs that may adversely affect legitimate users. In this paper, we present DeepGuard, to the best of our knowledge, the first physical-layer defense framework for DeepJSCC against eavesdropping attacks, validated through over-the-air experiments using software-defined radios (SDRs). Considering that existing eavesdropping attacks against DeepJSCC are limited to simulation under ideal channels, we take a step further by identifying and implementing four representative types of attacks under various configurations in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. These attacks are evaluated over-the-air under diverse scenarios, allowing us to comprehensively characterize the real-world threat landscape. To mitigate these threats, DeepGuard introduces a novel preamble perturbation mechanism that modifies the preamble shared only between legitimate transceivers. To realize it, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's impact on the signals intercepted by the eavesdropper. Building upon this, we develop an end-to-end perturbation optimization algorithm that significantly degrades eavesdropping performance while preserving reliable communication for legitimate users. We prototype DeepGuard using SDRs and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments in practical scenarios.

As data-driven models increasingly support the assessment of civil structures, the persistent challenge of transferring knowledge across varying geometries, materials, and environmental conditions remains a major obstacle. DA offers a systematic approach to mitigate these discrepancies by aligning feature distributions between simulated, laboratory, and field domains while preserving the sensitivity of damage-related information. Drawing on more than sixty representative studies, this paper analyzes the evolution of DA methods for SHM, including statistical alignment, adversarial and subdomain learning, physics-informed adaptation, and generative modeling for simulation-to-real transfer. The review summarizes their contributions and limitations across bridge and building applications, revealing that while DA has improved generalization significantly, key challenges persist: managing domain discrepancy, addressing data scarcity, enhancing model interpretability, and enabling adaptability to multiple sources and time-varying conditions. Future research directions emphasize integrating physical constraints into learning objectives, developing physics-consistent generative frameworks to enhance data realism, establishing interpretable and certifiable DA systems for engineering practice, and advancing multi-source and lifelong adaptation for scalable monitoring. Overall, this review consolidates the methodological foundation of DA for SHM, identifies existing barriers to generalization and trust, and outlines the technological trajectory toward transparent, physics-aware, and adaptive monitoring systems that support the long-term resilience of civil infrastructure."}

The operating principles and state-of-the-art hardware architectures of programmable metasurfaces are first introduced. Subsequently, key performance objectives and use cases of RIS-enabled SWEs, including spectral and energy efficiency, physical-layer security, integrated sensing and communications, as well as the emerging paradigm of over-the-air computing, are discussed. Focusing on the recent trend of Beyond-Diagonal (BD) RISs, two distributed designs of respective SWEs are presented. The first deals with a multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) system operating within the area of influence of a SWE comprising multiple BD-RISs. A hybrid distributed and fusion machine learning framework based on multi-branch attention-based convolutional Neural Networks (NNs), NN parameter sharing, and neuroevolutionary training is presented, which enables online mapping of channel realizations to the BD-RIS configurations as well as the multi-user transmit precoder. Performance evaluation results showcase that the distributedly optimized RIS-enabled SWE achieves near-optimal sum-rate performance with low online computational complexity. The second design focuses on the wideband interference MISO broadcast channel, where each base station exclusively controls one BD-RIS to serve its assigned group of users. A cooperative optimization framework that jointly designs the base station transmit precoders as well as the tunable capacitances and switch matrices of all metasurfaces is presented. Numerical results demonstrating the superior sum-rate performance of the designed RIS-enabled SWE for multi-cell MISO networks over benchmark schemes, considering non-cooperative configuration and conventional diagonal metasurfaces, are presented."}

While such cooperation can substantially enhance link budgets and achievable rates, its practical realization is challenged by the scalability limitations of centralized beamforming designs and the stringent computational and signaling constraints of large LEO constellations. This paper develops a fully decentralized cooperative beamforming framework for networked LEO satellite downlinks. Using an ergodic-rate-based formulation, we first derive a centralized weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) solution as a performance benchmark. Building on this formulation, we propose a topology-agnostic decentralized beamforming algorithm by localizing the benchmark and exchanging a set of globally coupled variables whose dimensions are independent of the antenna number and enforcing consensus over arbitrary connected inter-satellite networks. The resulting algorithm admits fully parallel execution across satellites. To further enhance scalability, we eliminate the consensus-related auxiliary variables in closed form and derive a low-complexity per-satellite update rule that is optimal to local iteration and admits a quasi-closed-form solution via scalar line search. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralized schemes closely approach centralized performance under practical inter-satellite topologies, while significantly reducing computational complexity and signaling overhead, enabling scalable cooperative beamforming for large LEO constellations."}

This paper bridges this gap by presenting a novel framework that unlocks a realistic performance analysis for FAS-RIS systems with finite elements. Leveraging a Gamma distribution approximation, we derive a new, tractable closed-form expression for the outage probability. Numerical results validate our approach, demonstrating that it offers a significantly more accurate performance characterization than conventional CLT-based methods, particularly in the practical regime of small-scale RIS.

This article envisions a transformative FAS-RIS integrated architecture for future smart city networks, uniting the adaptability of FAS with the environmental control of RIS. The proposed framework has five key applications: FAS-enabled base stations (BSs) for large-scale beamforming, FAS-equipped user devices with finest spatial diversity, and three novel RIS paradigms -- fluid RIS (FRIS) with reconfigurable elements, FAS-embedded RIS as active relays, and enormous FAS (E-FAS) exploiting surface waves on facades to re-establish line-of-sight (LoS) communication.

Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a \"useful subspace,\" highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program.

While AI-enabled CSI feedback has achieved significant advances, especially in precoding matrix index feedback, AI-based CQI feedback remains underexplored. Conventional subband-based CQI approaches, due to coarse granularity, often fail to capture fine frequency-selective variations and thus lead to suboptimal resource allocation. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback framework tailored for 6G and NextG systems. First, we introduce CQInet, an autoencoder-based scheme that compresses per-subcarrier CQI at the user equipment and reconstructs it at the base station, significantly reducing feedback overhead without compromising CQI accuracy. Simulation results show that CQInet increases the effective data rate by 7.6% relative to traditional subband CQI under equivalent feedback overhead. Building on this, we develop SR-CQInet, which leverages super-resolution to infer fine-grained subcarrier CQI from sparsely reported CSI reference signals (CSI-RS). SR-CQInet reduces CSI-RS overhead to 3.5% of CQInet's requirements while maintaining comparable throughput. These results demonstrate that AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback can substantially enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in future wireless networks."}

However, conventional SEI techniques are primarily designed for single-emitter scenarios. This poses a fundamental limitation in distributed wireless networks, where simultaneous transmissions from multiple emitters result in overlapping signals that conventional single-emitter identification methods cannot effectively handle. To overcome this limitation, we present a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) framework via multi-label learning, treating identification as a problem of directly decoding emitter states from overlapping signals. Theoretically, we establish performance bounds using Fano's inequality. Methodologically, the multi-label formulation reduces output dimensionality from exponential to linear scale, thereby substantially decreasing computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an improved SMEI (I-SMEI), which incorporates multi-head attention to effectively capture features in correlated signal combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SMEI achieves high identification accuracy with a linear computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed I-SMEI scheme significantly improves identification accuracy across various overlapping scenarios compared to the proposed SMEI and other advanced methods."}

The signal of each anchor is generated by transmitting a sequence of known symbols, allowing for amplitude and duration (number of symbols) to be different from anchor to anchor. The problem is the minimization of the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals imposing a constraint on the performance of the tracking procedure. Specifically, the constraint is the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound, below the mean square error achieved by any unbiased estimator. The main improvement over the previous literature is the derivation of a formula that, at each step of the tracking, allows to calculate in closed form the first-order variation of the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound as a function of the variation of the total energy. To concretely show the application of our approach, we present also two numerical algorithms that implement the constrained optimization in the case of signals of fixed amplitude and variable duration transmitted from the anchors in a time division multiplexing scheme."}

Remifentanil, an analgesic widely used during anesthesia, presents a dosing challenge due to the absence of an universally accepted indicator of analgesia. To examine how changes in patient state correlate with adjustments in remifentanil target concentration triggered by the practitioner, we analyzed data from two sources: VitalDB (Seoul, Korea) and PREDIMED (Grenoble, France). Results show that only features derived from arterial pressure are consistently associated with changes in remifentanil targets. This finding is robust across both datasets despite variations in specific thresholds. In particular, increases in remifentanil targets are associated with high or rising arterial pressure over short periods (1--2 minutes), whereas decreases are linked to low, stable, or declining arterial pressure over longer periods (5--7 minutes). By capturing anesthesiologists' dosing strategies we provide a foundation for the future development of closed-loop control algorithms. Beyond the specific example of remifentanil's change prediction, the proposed feature generation and associated sparse fitting approach can be applied to other domain where human decision can be viewed as sensors interpretation."}

In this realm, the emergence of malicious ISAC systems has amplified the need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links and protect legitimate targets from potential detection or exploitation by malicious foes. In this paper, we propose a new wireless proactive monitoring paradigm, where a legitimate monitor intercepts a suspicious communication link while performing cognitive jamming to enhance the monitoring success probability (MSP) and simultaneously safeguard the target. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the user (UE), sensing access points (S-APs), and an approximating expression of the SINR at the proactive monitor. Moreover, we propose an optimization technique under which the legitimate monitor minimizes the success detection probability (SDP) of the legitimate target, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over both communication and sensing channels subject to total power constraints and monitoring performance requirement. To enhance the monitor's longevity and reduce the risk of detection by malicious ISAC systems, we further propose an adaptive power allocation scheme aimed at minimizing the total transmit power at the monitor while meeting a pre-selected sensing SINR threshold and ensuring successful monitoring.
