Supplementary material is included", "summary": "The demand for high-resolution, non-invasive imaging continues to drive innovation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet prolonged acquisition times hinder accessibility and real-time applications. While deep learning-based reconstruction methods have accelerated MRI, their predominant supervised paradigm depends on fully-sampled reference data that are challenging to acquire. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have emerged as promising alternatives, but most are empirically designed and fragmented. Therefore, we introduce UNITS (Unified Theory for Self-supervision), a general framework for self-supervised MRI reconstruction. UNITS unifies prior SSL strategies within a common formalism, enabling consistent interpretation and systematic benchmarking. We prove that SSL can achieve the same expected performance as supervised learning. Under this theoretical guarantee, we introduce sampling stochasticity and flexible data utilization, which improve network generalization under out-of-domain distributions and stabilize training. Together, these contributions establish UNITS as a theoretical foundation and a practical paradigm for interpretable, generalizable, and clinically applicable self-supervised MRI reconstruction."}

This study evaluates whether a unified processing framework can be applied to radar-based spatiotemporal gait analysis independent of radar modality. The framework is validated using collocated impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars under identical processing settings, without modality-specific tuning, during repeated overground walking trials with 10 healthy participants. A modality-independent approach for automatic walking-segment identification is also introduced to ensure fair and reproducible modality performance assessment. Clinically relevant spatiotemporal gait parameters, including stride time, stride length, walking speed, swing time, and stance time, extracted from each modality were compared against gold-standard motion capture reference estimates. Across all parameters, both radar modalities achieved comparably high mean estimation accuracy in the range of 85-98%, with inter-modality differences remaining below 4.1%, resulting in highly overlapping accuracy distributions. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses revealed minimal bias, comparable limits of agreement, and strong agreement with reference estimates, while intraclass correlation analysis demonstrated high consistency between radar modalities. These findings indicate that no practically meaningful performance differences arise from radar modality when using a shared processing framework, supporting the feasibility of radar-agnostic gait analysis systems."}

Designing neural architectures for onboard execution, particularly for satellite-based hyperspectral imagers, poses novel challenges due to the unique constraints of this environment and imaging system that are largely unexplored by the traditional computer vision literature. In this paper, we show that this setting requires addressing three competing objectives, namely high-quality inference with low complexity, dynamic power scalability and fault tolerance. We focus on the problem of hyperspectral image denoising, which is a critical task to enable effective downstream inference, and highlights the constraints of the onboard processing scenario. We propose a neural network design that addresses the three aforementioned objectives with several novel contributions. In particular, we propose a mixture of denoisers that can be resilient to radiation-induced faults as well as allowing for time-varying power scaling. Moreover, each denoiser employs an innovative architecture where an image is processed line-by-line in a causal way, with a memory of past lines, in order to match the acquisition process of pushbroom hyperspectral sensors and greatly limit memory requirements. We show that the proposed architecture can run in real-time, i.e., process one line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware and provide competitive denoising quality with respect to significantly more complex state-of-the-art models. We also show that the power scalability and fault tolerance objectives provide a design space with multiple tradeoffs between those properties and denoising quality."}

These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification."}

We find the traditional direct georectification method to be slow, and it is prone to artifacts. To address its downsides, we propose Spacecube, a program that implements a complete hyperspectral georectification pipeline, including our own fast inverse georectification technique, using OpenGL graphics programming technologies. Spacecube operates substantially faster than real-time and eliminates pixel coverage artifacts. It facilitates high quality interactive viewing, data exploration, and export of final products. We release Spacecube's source code publicly for the community to use."}

However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC."}

Based on empirical observations that only a minority of spectral points with strong power contribute to wave energy, the proposed SPT effectively integrates geometric and spectral characteristics of ocean surface waves to estimate Hs through multi-dimensional feature representation. The experiment reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the learned features of SPT align well with physical dispersion relations, where the contribution-score map of selected points is concentrated along dispersion curves. Compared to conventional vision networks that process image sequences and full spectra, SPT demonstrates superior performance in Hs regression while consuming significantly fewer computational resources. On a consumer-grade GPU, SPT completes the training of regression model for 1080 sea clutter image sequences within 4 minutes, showcasing its potential to reduce deployment costs for radar wave-measuring systems.

Multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) beam map provides such spatial awareness, yet accurate construction under sparse measurements remains difficult due to incomplete spatial coverage and strong angular variations. This paper presents a tensor decomposition approach for reconstructing MIMO beam map from limited measurements. By transforming measurements from a Cartesian coordinate system into a polar coordinate system, we uncover a matrix-vector outer-product structure associated with different propagation conditions. Specifically, we mathematically demonstrate that the matrix factor, representing beam-space gain, exhibits an intrinsic Toeplitz structure due to the shift-invariant nature of array responses, and the vector factor captures distance-dependent attenuation. Leveraging these structural priors, we formulate a regularized tensor decomposition problem to jointly reconstruct line-of-sight (LOS), reflection, and obstruction propagation conditions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency, achieving a normalized mean square error (NMSE) reduction of over 20% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, even under sparse sampling regimes."}

The standard approach, expectation-maximization (EM), often becomes computationally prohibitive, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. We introduce an alternative, ultra-fast algorithm for MRA over the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$. By performing a Taylor expansion of the log-likelihood in the low-SNR regime, we estimate the signal by sequentially computing data-driven averages of observations. Our method requires only one pass over the data, dramatically reducing computational cost compared to EM.

In particular, two practical operating protocols, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM) and waveguide switching (WS), are considered. A multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to jointly optimize the baseband and pinching beamforming for maximizing the achievable SE and EE, which is then converted into a single-objective problem via the ε-constraint method. For WM, the problem is decomposed within the alternating-optimization framework, where the baseband beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation, and the pinching beamforming is updated through the particle swarm optimization. For WS, due to the time-division transmission and interference-free nature, the pinching beamforming in each time slot is first adjusted to maximize the served user channel gain, followed by the baseband power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) PASS outperforms conventional antennas by mitigating large-scale path losses; 2) WS leads to a higher maximum achievable EE by activating a single RF chain, whereas WM yields a higher SE upper bound by serving all users concurrently; and 3) increasing the number of users substantially enhances SE under WM, whereas WS shows more pronounced benefits in low-signal-to-noise ratio regimes."}

In this system, each distributed access point (AP) can flexibly adjust its array orientation and antenna positions to adapt to spatial channel variations and enhance communication performance. However, frequent antenna movements and centralized beamforming based on global instantaneous channel state information (CSI) sharing among APs entail extremely high signal processing delay and system overhead, which is difficult to be practically implemented in high-mobility scenarios with short channel coherence time. To address these practical implementation challenges and improve scalability, a two-timescale decentralized optimization framework is proposed in this paper to jointly design the beamformer, antenna positions, and array orientations. In the short timescale, each AP updates its receive beamformer based on local instantaneous CSI and global statistical CSI. In the long timescale, the central processing unit optimizes the antenna positions and array orientations at all APs based on global statistical CSI to maximize the ergodic sum rate of all users. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, thus posing significant challenges for obtaining efficient solutions. To address this problem, a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation algorithm is developed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided cell-free system with decentralized beamforming significantly outperforms other antenna movement schemes with less flexibility and even achieves a performance comparable to that of the centralized beamforming benchmark."}

A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution."}

One key challenge is to resolve the integer ambiguity problem, as the carrier phase provides only relative position information. This work introduces and studies a multi-band CPP scenario with intra- and inter-band carrier aggregation (CA) opportunities across FR1, mmWave-FR2, and emerging 6G FR3 bands. Specifically, we derive multi-band CPP performance bounds, showcasing the superiority of multi-band CPP for high-precision localization in current and future mobile networks, while noting also practical imperfections such as clock offsets between the user equipment (UE) and the network as well as mutual clock imperfections between the network nodes. A wide collection of numerical results is provided, covering the impacts of the available carrier bandwidth, number of aggregated carriers, transmit power, and the number of network nodes or base stations. The offered results highlight that only two carriers suffice to substantially facilitate resolving the integer ambiguity problem while also largely enhancing the robustness of positioning against imperfections imposed by the network-side clocks and multi-path propagation. In addition, we also propose a two-stage practical estimator that achieves the derived bounds under all realistic bandwidth and transmit power conditions. Furthermore, we show that with an additional search-based refinement step, the proposed estimator becomes particularly suitable for narrowband Internet of Things applications operating efficiently even under narrow carrier bandwidths. Finally, both the derived bounds and the proposed estimators are extended to scenarios where the bands assigned to each base station are nonuniform or fully disjoint, enhancing the practical deployment flexibility."}
