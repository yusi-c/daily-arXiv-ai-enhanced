However, the nonlinear nature of specklegram data presents significant challenges for accurate temperature prediction. This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency. These findings establish transformer architectures as strong benchmarks for optical fiber-based temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications."}

Accepted to SPIE Medical Imaging 2026: Image Processing", "summary": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a distinctive means to probe the microstructural architecture of living tissue, facilitating applications such as brain connectivity analysis, modeling across multiple conditions, and the estimation of macrostructural features. Tractography, which emerged in the final years of the 20th century and accelerated in the early 21st century, is a technique for visualizing white matter pathways in the brain using dMRI. Most diffusion tractography methods rely on procedural streamline propagators or global energy minimization methods. Although recent advancements in deep learning have enabled tasks that were previously challenging, existing tractography approaches are often non-differentiable, limiting their integration in end-to-end learning frameworks. While progress has been made in representing streamlines in differentiable frameworks, no existing method offers fully differentiable propagation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable solution that retains numerical fidelity with a leading streamline algorithm. The key is that our PyTorch-engineered streamline propagator has no components that block gradient flow, making it fully differentiable. We show that our method matches standard propagators while remaining differentiable. By translating streamline propagation into a differentiable PyTorch framework, we enable deeper integration of tractography into deep learning workflows, laying the foundation for a new category of macrostructural reasoning that is not only computationally robust but also scientifically rigorous."}

Foundation models offer a more scalable alternative by enabling a single model to be adapted across multiple tasks through fine-tuning with limited samples. However, current foundation models mostly rely on large-scale Transformer architectures, resulting in computationally intensive models unsuitable for deployment on typical edge devices. This paper presents a lightweight foundation model based on simple Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) encoders that independently process input patches. Our model supports 4 types of downstream tasks (long-range technology recognition, short-range technology recognition, modulation recognition and line-of-sight-detection) from multiple input types (IQ and CIR) and different sampling rates. We show that, unlike Transformers, which can exhibit performance drops as downstream tasks are added, our MLP model maintains robust generalization performance, achieving over 97% accurate fine-tuning results for previously unseen data classes. These results are achieved despite having only 21K trainable parameters, allowing an inference time of 0.33 ms on common edge devices, making the model suitable for constrained real-time deployments."}

To provide a solid training foundation for WiCo-MG, a new synthetic intelligent sensing-communication dataset for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-ground (U2G) communications is constructed. To overcome the challenges of cross-modal alignment and mapping, a two-stage training framework is proposed. In the first stage, sensing images are embedded into discrete-continuous SoM feature spaces, and multipath maps are embedded into a sensing-initialized discrete SoM space to align the representations. In the second stage, a mixture of shared and routed experts (S-R MoE) Transformer with frequency-aware expert routing learns the mapping from sensing to channel SoM feature spaces, enabling decoupled and adaptive multipath generation. Experimental results demonstrate that WiCo-MG achieves state-of-the-art in-distribution generation performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization, reducing NMSE by more than 2.59 dB over baselines, while exhibiting strong scalability in model and dataset growth and extensibility to new multipath parameters and tasks.

However, conventional RISs are typically modeled using diagonal scattering matrices, capturing only independent reflections from each reflecting element, which limits their flexibility in channel manipulation. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) employ non-diagonal scattering matrices enabled by active and tunable inter-element connections through a shared impedance network. This architecture significantly enhances channel shaping capabilities, creating new opportunities for advanced PLS techniques. This paper investigates PLS in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by BD-RISs, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends confidential information to a multi-antenna legitimate user while a multi-antenna eavesdropper attempts interception. To maximize the secrecy rate (SR), we formulate it as a non-convex optimization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS REs under power and structural constraints. To solve this problem, we first introduce an auxiliary variable to decouple BD-RIS constraints. We then propose a low-complexity penalty product Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (P-PRCGD) method, which combines the augmented Lagrangian (AL) approach with the product manifold gradient descent (PMGD) method to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution.

The integration of large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance PLS. However, LSAA requires a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna element, and IRS comprises hundreds of reflecting micro-antennas, leading to increased hardware costs and power consumption. To address this, cost-effective solutions like constant modulus analog beamforming (CMAB) have gained attention. This paper investigates PLS in IRS-assisted communication systems with a focus on jointly designing the CMAB at the transmitter and phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. The resulting secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is non-convex. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms: (1) the time-efficient Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm, which reformulates the fractional problem into a series of quadratic programs using the Dinkelbach method and solves them via block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM), and (2) the product manifold conjugate gradient descent (PMCGD) algorithm, which provides a better solution at the cost of slightly higher computational time by transforming the problem into an unconstrained optimization on a Riemannian product manifold and solving it using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithm.

The resulting problem is non-convex, and we propose a penalty product manifold (PPM) method to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we convert the inequality constraints related to MA position into a penalty function using smoothing techniques, thereby reformulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization on the product manifold space (PMS). We then derive a parallel conjugate gradient descent (PCGD) algorithm to update both the AB and MA position on the PMS.

To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new two-layer MA array (TL-MA), where the positions of MAs are jointly determined by the large-scale movement of multiple subarrays and the small-scale fine-tuning of per-subarray MAs. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of the TL-MA-aided communication system by jointly optimizing the subarray-positions, per-subarray (relative) MA positions, and receive beamforming. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which alternately optimizes the positions of subarrays and per-subarray MAs, given the optimal receive beamforming. Numerical results verify that the proposed TL-MA significantly reduces the sum-displacement of MA motors (i.e., the total moving distances of all motors) of element-wise SL-MA, while achieving comparable rate performance."}

WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities.

In this paper, we propose a space-time-frequency synthetic ISAC architecture that fuses observations from distributed transmitters and receivers across time intervals and frequency bands. We develop a unified signal model for multistatic and monostatic configurations, derive Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the estimations of position and velocity. The analysis shows how spatial diversity, multiband operation, and observation scheduling impact the Fisher information. We also compare the estimation performance between a concentrated maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and a two stage information fusion (TSIF) method that first estimates per-path delay and radial speed and then fuses them by solving a weighted nonlinear least-squares problem via the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Numerical results show that MLE approaches the CRLB in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while the two stage method remains competitive at moderate to high SNR but degrades at low SNR. A central finding is that fully synthesized network processing is essential, as estimations by individual base stations (BSs) followed by fusion are consistently inferior and unstable at low SNR. This framework offers a practical guidance for upgrading existing communication infrastructure into dense sensing networks."}

Existing countermeasures for NLOS either use prior knowledge on the environment to characterize all the multiple bounces or deploy anomalous reflectors in the environment to enable communication infrastructure to ''\\textit{see behind the corner}''. This work addresses the integration of monostatic NLOS imaging functionalities into the initial access (IA) procedure of a next generation base station (BS), by means of a non-reconfigurable modular reflector. During standard-compliant IA, the BS sweeps a narrow beam using a pre-defined dedicated codebook to achieve the beam alignment with users. We introduce the imaging functionality by enhancing such codebook with imaging-specific entries that are jointly designed with the angular configuration of the modular reflector to enable high-resolution imaging of a region in NLOS by \\textit{coherently} processing all the echoes at the BS. We derive closed-form expressions for the near-field (NF) spatial resolution, as well as for the \\textit{effective aperture} (i.e., the portion of the reflector that actively contributes to improve image resolution). The problem of imaging of moving targets in NLOS is also addressed, and we propose a maximum-likelihood estimation for target's velocity in NF and related theoretical bound. Further, we discuss and quantify the inherent communication-imaging performance trade-offs and related system design challenges through numerical simulations. Finally, the proposed imaging method employing modular reflectors is validated both numerically and experimentally, showing the effectiveness of our concept."}

Closed-form expressions for target localizability and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) distribution are analytically derived, enabling the evaluation of the fundamental limits of PA-assisted localization systems without extensive simulations.

In this paper, we propose a division-based receiver-agnostic RFF extraction method for WiFi systems, which removes the receivers' effects by dividing different preambles in the frequency domain. The proposed method requires only a single receiver for training and does not rely on additional calibration or stacking processes. First, for flat fading channel scenarios, the legacy short training field (L-STF) and legacy long training field (L-LTF) of the unknown device are divided by those of the reference device in the frequency domain. The receiver-dependent effects can be eliminated with the requirement of only a single receiver for training, and the higher-dimensional RFF features can be extracted. Second, for frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, the high-throughput long training field (HT-LTF) is divided by the L-LTF in the frequency domain. Only a single receiver is required for training and the higher-dimensional RFF features that are both channel-invariant and receiver-agnostic are extracted. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigate the impacts of channel variations and receiver differences. The classification results show that, even when training on a single receiver and testing on a different one, the proposed method achieves classification accuracy improvements of 15.5% and 28.45% over the state-of-the-art approach in flat fading and frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, respectively."}

We first introduce an approach that exploits the zero constant modulus (ZCM) criterion to separate colliding tags through gradient descent, without using pilot symbols. We show that the ZCM characteristic, considered alone, in the design of the objective function can lead to significant ambiguities in the determination of the beamformers used in the recovery of tag messages. To address this limitation, we propose a more sophisticated approach, relying on a hybrid objective function, incorporating a new ambiguity-raising criterion in addition to the ZCM criterion."}

Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis in complex industrial systems."}

These systems often suffer from destructive interference at the destination node due to uncoordinated transmissions of common packets by cooperating UAVs. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of virtual transmit channels at each UAV, implemented using truncated all-pass filters (APFs). This approach ensures that all subcarriers benefit from comparable transmit powers, guaranteeing excellent performance when a single UAV is transmitting. In scenarios where multiple UAVs cooperate without coordination, the inherent randomness of the generated virtual channels facilitates cooperative diversity, effectively mitigating destructive interference. We further integrate this method with the distributed randomized space-time block coding (STBC) scheme to enhance transmission reliability. Additionally, we propose efficient algorithms for estimating the composite channels that combine both the true propagation channels and the virtual channels. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms the classical phase dithering scheme across various scenarios."}

Token is the unified input and output representation in Transformer-based models, which has become a fundamental information unit. In this work, we consider the problem of token communication, studying how to transmit tokens efficiently and reliably. Point cloud, a prevailing three-dimensional format which exhibits a more complex spatial structure compared to image or video, is chosen to be the information source. We utilize the set abstraction method to obtain point tokens. Subsequently, to get a more informative and transmission-friendly representation based on tokens, we propose a joint semantic-channel and modulation (JSCCM) scheme for the token encoder, mapping point tokens to standard digital constellation points (modulated tokens). Specifically, the JSCCM consists of two parallel Point Transformer-based encoders and a differential modulator which combines the Gumel-softmax and soft quantization methods. Besides, the rate allocator and channel adapter are developed, facilitating adaptive generation of high-quality modulated tokens conditioned on both semantic information and channel conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both joint semantic-channel coding and traditional separate coding, achieving over 1dB gain in reconstruction and more than 6x compression ratio in modulated symbols."}
