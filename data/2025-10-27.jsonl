Current diagnostic modalities\nincluding Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have\nsignificant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure\ndependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study\ninvestigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using\nUltrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring\ntissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze\nultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with\nrecording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed\nground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization\nand Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining\ncomponents explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate\nmultiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural\nnetwork, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations:\noriginal 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space.\nResults demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier\nperformance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of\n0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance.\nThese findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH\ndetection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications\nin emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where\ntraditional imaging is unavailable."}

This pilot\nstudy used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which\naspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180\nchest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary\nnodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall\ndisplay sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and\n1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with\nBBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements\nwere recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time,\ntime to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path\nlength, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear\nmixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as\nrandom intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives\n(n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s\n(p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path\nlength increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio\nincreased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced\nby 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in\nsearch behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph\ninterpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and\nhighlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore\nimplications across modalities and clinical contexts."}

Accurate delineation of\nthese tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet\nremains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent\ndevelopments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor\nsegmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy\ncomputational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible\nfor researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we\npropose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three\ndistinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an\nattention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a\ndual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The\nensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and\naccuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was\ntrained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The\nproposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average\nLesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for\nEnhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These\nresults highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor\nsegmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method\nprovides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of\nmeningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings."}

Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold\ndetectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often\nlarge amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort\ncomplex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study\nexplores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale\napplications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be\nanalyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying\ndynamics.\n  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two\nsingle-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it\nboth in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated\nand real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the\nproposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection\ncompared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is\nfurther improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while\noutperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based\ndetection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal\nidentification, with potential applications in various disciplines."}

Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification\nand phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they\ninevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become\nparticularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink\n(DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among\naccess points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes\na non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals.\nTo underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve\nperformance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then\ndevelop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization.\nNumerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the\nrepeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference."}

However, its amplitude-controlled holographic\nbeamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully\nexploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna\n(6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a\n6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer\n(IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an\nuplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink\ntransmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET\nreceivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and\nthe sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing\nthe rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization\nproblem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and\nadjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with\nmaximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by\nfixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the\nequivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization\nproblem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power\nsplitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET\nperformance compared to the benchmarks."}
