By leveraging a novel method, we derive exact SEP expressions for a quadrature PSK (QPSK)-modulated n-bit phase-quantized SIMO system with maximum ratio combining (SIMO-MRC), along with the corresponding high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characterizations in terms of diversity and coding gains. For a QPSK-modulated 2-bit phase-quantized SIMO system with selection combining, the diversity and coding gains are further obtained for an arbitrary number of receive antennas, complementing existing results. Interestingly, the proposed method also reveals a duality between a SIMO-MRC system and a phase-quantized multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with maximum ratio transmission, when the modulation order, phase-quantization resolution, antenna configuration, and the channel state information (CSI) conditions are reciprocal. This duality enables direct inference to obtain the diversity of a general M-PSK-modulated n-bit phase-quantized SIMO-MRC system, and extends the results to its MISO counterpart. All the above results have been obtained assuming perfect CSI at the receiver (CSIR). Finally, the SEP analysis of a QPSK-modulated 2-bit phase-quantized SIMO system is extended to the limited CSIR case, where the CSI at each receive antenna is represented by only 2 bits of channel phase information. In this scenario, the diversity gain is shown to be further halved in general."}

In this regime, signals exhibit spherical wave propagation, unlike the planar waves in conventional far-field systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to support NFC beamfocusing, concentrating signal energy at specific spatial coordinates. However, effective RIS utilization depends on both rapid channel state information (CSI) estimation and proactive blockage mitigation, which occur on inherently different timescales. CSI varies at millisecond intervals due to small-scale fading, while blockage events evolve over seconds, posing challenges for conventional single-level control algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a dual-transformer (DT) hierarchical framework that integrates two specialized transformer models within a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) architecture, referred to as the DT-HDRL framework. A fast-timescale transformer processes ray-tracing data for rapid CSI estimation, while a vision transformer (ViT) analyzes visual data to predict impending blockages. In HDRL, the high-level controller selects line-of-sight (LoS) or RIS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission paths and sets goals, while the low-level controller optimizes base station (BS) beamfocusing and RIS phase shifts using instantaneous CSI. This dual-timescale coordination maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring robust performance under dynamic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves SE by approximately 18% compared to single-timescale baselines, while the proposed blockage predictor achieves an F1-score of 0.92, providing a 769 ms advance warning window in dynamic scenarios."}

However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

We challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that powerful pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models can be efficiently adapted for multiple restoration tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with remarkably few examples. Our approach fine-tunes LoRA adapters on FLUX.1 Kontext, a state-of-the-art 12B parameter flow matching model for image-to-image translation, using only 16-128 paired images per task, guided by simple text prompts that specify the restoration operation. Unlike existing methods that train specialized restoration networks from scratch with thousands of samples, we leverage the rich visual priors already encoded in large-scale pre-trained editing models, dramatically reducing data requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. A single unified LoRA adapter, conditioned on task-specific text prompts, effectively handles multiple degradations including denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze: (i) the impact of training set size on restoration quality, (ii) trade-offs between task-specific versus unified multi-task adapters, (iii) the role of text encoder fine-tuning, and (iv) zero-shot baseline performance. While our method prioritizes perceptual quality over pixel-perfect reconstruction metrics like PSNR/SSIM, our results demonstrate that pre-trained image editing models, when properly adapted, offer a compelling and data-efficient alternative to traditional image restoration approaches, opening new avenues for few-shot, prompt-guided image enhancement.

While significant progresses have been achieved for the theoretical studies, the further advancement of ISAC is hampered by the lack of accessible, open-source, and real-time experimental platforms. To address this gap, we introduce OpenISAC, a versatile and high-performance open-source platform for real-time ISAC experimentation. OpenISAC utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform and implements crucial sensing functionalities, including both monostatic and bistatic delay-Doppler sensing. A key feature of our platform is a novel over-the-air (OTA) synchronization mechanism that enables robust bistatic operations without requiring a wired connection between nodes. The platform is built entirely on open-source software, leveraging the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) hardware driver (UHD) library, thus eliminating the need for any commercial licenses. It supports a wide range of software-defined radios, from the cost-effective USRP B200 series to the high-performance X400 series. The physical layer modulator and demodulator are implemented with C++ for high-speed processing, while the sensing data is streamed to a Python environment, providing a user-friendly interface for rapid prototyping and validation of sensing signal processing algorithms. With flexible parameter selection and real-time communication and sensing operation, OpenISAC serves as a powerful and accessible tool for the academic and research communities to explore and innovate within the field of OFDM-ISAC."}

However, existing generative methods primarily operate within the image domain, neglecting explicit geometric information. This limitation often leads to unsatisfactory generation quality and the inability to precisely control critical parameters such as azimuth angles. To address these challenges, we propose GeoDiff-SAR, a geometric prior guided diffusion model for high-fidelity SAR image generation. Specifically, GeoDiff-SAR first efficiently simulates the geometric structures and scattering relationships inherent in real SAR imaging by calculating SAR point clouds at specific azimuths, which serves as a robust physical guidance. Secondly, to effectively fuse multi-modal information, we employ a feature fusion gating network based on Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to dynamically regulate the weight distribution of 3D physical information, image control parameters, and textual description parameters. Thirdly, we utilize the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) architecture to perform lightweight fine-tuning on the advanced Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5) model, enabling it to rapidly adapt to the distribution characteristics of the SAR domain. To validate the effectiveness of GeoDiff-SAR, extensive comparative experiments were conducted on real-world SAR datasets. The results demonstrate that data generated by GeoDiff-SAR exhibits high fidelity and effectively enhances the accuracy of downstream classification tasks. In particular, it significantly improves recognition performance across different azimuth angles, thereby underscoring the superiority of physics-guided generation."}

To alleviate the CSI feedback burden, the channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a promising approach by leveraging environment-aware techniques to predict CSI based solely on user locations. However, how to effectively construct a CKM remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose F$^4$-CKM, a novel CKM construction framework characterized by four distinctive features: radiance Field rendering, spatial-Frequency-awareness, location-Free usage, and Fast learning. Central to our design is the adaptation of radiance field rendering techniques from computer vision to the radio frequency (RF) domain, enabled by a novel Wireless Radiator Representation (WiRARE) network that captures the spatial-frequency characteristics of wireless channels.

Our method integrates a state-of-the-art pediatric brain tumor segmentation framework with radiomic feature extraction and clinical data through an ensemble of a Swin UNETR encoder and XGBoost classifier. The segmentation model delineates four tumor subregions enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, cystic component and edema which are used to extract imaging biomarkers and generate predictive features. The Swin UNETR network classifies the response to treatment directly from these segmented MRI scans, while XGBoost predicts response using radiomics and clinical variables including legal sex, ethnicity, race, age at event (in days), molecular subtype, tumor locations, initial surgery status, metastatic status, metastasis location, chemotherapy type, protocol name and chemotherapy agents. The ensemble output provides a non-invasive estimate of chemotherapy response in this historically challenging population characterized by lower progression-free survival. Among compared approaches, our Swin-Ensemble achieved the best performance (precision for non effective cases=0.68, recall for non effective cases=0.85, precision for chemotherapy effective cases=0.64 and overall accuracy=0.69), outperforming Mamba-FeatureFuse, Swin UNETR encoder, and Swin-FeatureFuse models. Our findings suggest that this ensemble framework represents a promising step toward personalized therapy response prediction for pediatric low-grade glioma patients in need of chemotherapy treatment who are not suitable for complete surgical resection, a population with significantly lower progression free survival and for whom chemotherapy remains the primary treatment option."}

This paper proposes a semi-blind atomic norm denoising scheme for Zak-OTFS ISAC with bistatic sensing. We first derive the discrete-time input-output (I/O) relationship of Zak-OTFS under fractional delay-Doppler shifts and rectangular windowing. Based on this I/O relation, we formulate the joint channel parameter estimation and data detection task as an atomic norm denoising problem, utilizing the negative square penalty method to handle the non-convex discrete constellation constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we develop an accelerated iterative algorithm that integrates majorization-minimization, accelerated projected gradient, and inexact accelerated proximal gradient methods. We provide a rigorous convergence proof for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves super-resolution sensing accuracy and communication performance approaching the perfect channel state information lower bound."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel low-complexity neural network for depth-guided image deblurring. We show that the use of the wavelet transform to separate structural details and reduce spatial redundancy as well as efficient feature conditioning on the depth information are essential ingredients in developing a low-complexity model. Experimental results show competitive image quality against recent state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity by up to two orders of magnitude."}

Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose a new two-stage multi-beam training method with two distinct multi-beam patterns to enable fast and accurate user angle identification. Specifically, in the first stage, the antenna array is divided into sparse subarrays to generate multiple beams (with high array gains), for identifying candidate user angles. In the second stage, the array is redivided into dense subarrays to generate flexibly steered wide beams, for which a cross-validation method is employed to effectively resolve the remaining angular ambiguity in the first stage. Last, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the success beam-identification rate compared to existing multi-beam training methods, while retaining or even reducing the required beam training overhead."}

In this domain, classical optimization methods resort to computationally costly conic optimization problems. Meanwhile, generic deep network (DN) architectures lack interpretability and require large training data sets to generalize well. In this paper, we therefore propose a lightweight model-aided deep learning architecture based on a greedy selection algorithm for analog beam codewords. The architecture relies on an instance-adaptive augmentation of the signal model to estimate the impact of the CSI error. To learn the DN parameters, we derive a novel and efficient implicit representation of the nested constrained BF problem and prove sufficient conditions for the existence of the corresponding gradient. In the loss function, we utilize an annealing-based approximation of the outage compared to conventional quantile-based loss terms. This approximation adaptively anneals towards the exact probabilistic constraint depending on the current level of quality of service (QoS) violation. Simulations validate that the proposed DN can achieve the nominal outage level under CSI error due to channel estimation and channel compression, while allocating less power than benchmarks. Thereby, a single trained model generalizes to different numbers of users, QoS requirements and levels of CSI quality. We further show that the adaptive annealing-based loss function can accelerate the training and yield a better power-outage trade-off."}
