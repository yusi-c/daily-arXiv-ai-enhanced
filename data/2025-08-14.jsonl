However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction\nexhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce\nRadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the\ntrade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range\nspatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics.\nRadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures\nthese global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel\nconvolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates\nfeature representations that capture both global context and local detail.\nExperiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing\nmethods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and\nusing only 2.9\\% of the model parameters.

Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial\nprofile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various\nsources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is\ncommonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible\nphysical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the\nSE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that\nthis more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over\nconventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor\ninspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher\ninformation about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements\n(TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter.\nEmpirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at\nvery low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of\nperformance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the\nraster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold\nreduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to\nconventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM\ndatasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4."}

In this\nwork, we introduce AMRG (Automatic Mammography Report Generation), the first\nend-to-end framework for generating narrative mammography reports using large\nvision-language models (VLMs). Building upon MedGemma-4B-it-a\ndomain-specialized, instruction-tuned VLM-we employ a parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) strategy via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling\nlightweight adaptation with minimal computational overhead. We train and\nevaluate AMRG on DMID, a publicly available dataset of paired high-resolution\nmammograms and diagnostic reports. This work establishes the first reproducible\nbenchmark for mammography report generation, addressing a longstanding gap in\nmultimodal clinical AI. We systematically explore LoRA hyperparameter\nconfigurations and conduct comparative experiments across multiple VLM\nbackbones, including both domain-specific and general-purpose models under a\nunified tuning protocol. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across\nboth language generation and clinical metrics, achieving a ROUGE-L score of\n0.5691, METEOR of 0.6152, CIDEr of 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy of 0.5582.\nQualitative analysis further highlights improved diagnostic consistency and\nreduced hallucinations.

In this study, we proposed a generative adversarial network\nmethod designed to reconstruct missing modalities from existing ones while\npreserving the disease patterns. We used T1-weighted structural magnetic\nresonance imaging and functional network connectivity as two modalities.

However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks\nfrom contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and\nlimited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a\nTime-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for\nsynthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from\nnon-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a\nconditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and\ntemporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic\ntime-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase\ninformation flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth\nand physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a\nconstraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion\nclassification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further\nenhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent\nliver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework\noffers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional\ncontrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and\nreliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is\npublicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE."}
