Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings highlight the potential of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling to improve non-invasive prostate cancer characterization and reduce unnecessary biopsies."}

It includes over 45,529 magnetic resonance images (MRI) from 6,211 subjects (9,229 imaging sessions) across 26 studies with heterogeneous organization formats, contrasts, acquisition parameters, and demographics. In this work, we organized all available structural and diffusion MRI from FITBIR along with relevant demographic information into the Brain Imaging Data Structure. We analyzed whole-brain mean fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, total intracranial volume, and the volumes of 132 regions of interest using UNesT segmentations. There were 4,868 subjects (7,035 sessions) with structural MRI and 2,666 subjects (3,763 sessions) with diffusion MRI following quality assurance and harmonization. We modeled profiles for these metrics across ages with generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) and found significant differences in subjects with TBI compared to controls in volumes of 54 regions of the brain (q<0.05, likelihood ratio test with false discovery rate correction)."}

However,existing low-rank sparse based methods still face high computational complexity when dealing with low-contrast small targets and complex dynamic backgrounds mixed with target-like interference. To address this limitation, we reconstruct the data into a fourth-order tensor and propose a new infrared small target detection model based on bilateral tensor ring decomposition, called BTR-ISTD. The approach begins by constructing a four-dimensional infrared tensor from an image sequence, then utilizes BTR decomposition to effectively distinguish weak spatial correlations from strong temporal-patch correlations while simultaneously capturing interactions between these two components. This model is efficiently solved under the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, background suppression capability, and computational speed."}

By combining input-adaptation and denoising regularization, Tada-DIP produces high-quality 3D reconstructions while avoiding the overfitting phenomenon that is common in DIP. Experiments on sparse-view X-ray computed tomography reconstruction validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that Tada-DIP produces much better reconstructions than training-data-free baselines and achieves reconstruction performance on par with a supervised network trained using a large dataset with fully-sampled volumes."}

This paper proposes an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) MIMO framework that uses Reconfigurable Pixel Antenna (RPixA), which introduces additional EM-domain DoF that are electronically controlled through binary antenna coder switch networks. We introduce a beamforming architecture combining this EM and digital precoding to jointly optimize Sensing and Communication. Based on full-wave simulation of pixel antenna, we formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem to maximize sensing rate under user-specific constraints on communication rate. We utilize an Alternating Optimization framework incorporating genetic algorithm for port states of Pixel antennas, and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed EM-aware design achieves considerably higher sensing rate compared to conventional arrays and enables considerable antenna reduction for equivalent ISAC performance. These findings highlight the potential of reconfigurable pixel antennas to realize efficient and scalable EM-aware ISAC systems for future 6G networks."}

In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music."}

A novel PASS-based multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework is proposed by exploiting the waveguide-division (WD) transmission characteristic. Specifically, each NOMA user cluster is served by one dedicated waveguide, and the corresponding pinching beamforming is exploited to enhance the intra-cluster performance while mitigating the inter-cluster interference. Based on this framework, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing power allocation, pinching beamforming, and user scheduling. To solve this problem, a two-step algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems. For the joint power allocation and pinching beamforming design, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm is proposed to obtain the locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the coupling constraints are alleviated through augmented Lagrangian relaxation, and the resulting augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem is decomposed into four subproblems, which are solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. For the user scheduling, a low-complexity matching algorithm is developed to solve the user-to-waveguide assignment problem. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-based NOMA framework under the WD transmission structure achieves significant sum-rate gain over conventional fixed-position antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; and 2) the proposed matching-based user scheduling algorithm achieves near-optimal user-waveguide association with low computational complexity."}

Channel measurement and modeling is a prerequisite for ISAC system design and has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. 3GPP Release 19 initiated the ISAC channel study item in December 2023 and finalized its modeling specification in May 2025 after extensive technical discussions. However, a comprehensive survey that provides a systematic overview,from empirical channel features to modeling methodologies and standardized simulators,remains unavailable. In this paper, the key requirements and challenges in ISAC channel research are first analyzed, followed by a structured overview of the standardization workflow throughout the 3GPP Release 19 process. Then, critical aspects of ISAC channels, including physical objects, target channels, and background channels, are examined in depth, together with additional features such as spatial consistency, environment objects, Doppler characteristics, and shared clusters, supported by measurement-based analysis. To establish a unified ISAC channel modeling framework, an Extended Geometry-based Stochastic Model (E-GBSM) is proposed, incorporating all the aforementioned ISAC channel characteristics. Finally, a standardized simulator is developed based on E-GBSM, and a two-phase calibration procedure aligned with 3GPP Release 19 is conducted to validate both the model and the simulator, demonstrating close agreement with industrial reference results. Overall, this paper provides a systematic survey of 3GPP Release 19 ISAC channel standardization and offers insights into best practices for new feature characterization, unified modeling methodology, and standardized simulator implementation, which can effectively supporting ISAC technology evaluation and future 6G standardization."}

The concept of FAS has emerged as an attractive new technology for use in sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems, but most implementations of FAS rely on mechanically reconfigurable antennas which are hindered by inertia, and are therefore too slow to be useful. Using the insight that changing an antenna's physical position is equivalent to switching the excitation current vector of a multi-port antenna, a novel beamformer is proposed with a scalable methodology for incorporating into FAS to form a PRBFN-FAS. Key novelties in creating the PRBFN include selecting the required current vectors and concatenating beamforming networks together to form the desired PRBFN. Two PRBFN-FAS design examples are demonstrated with FAS equivalent physical movements of 0.5 and 1.5 wavelengths. Measurements demonstrate that the PRBFN-FAS provides good matching and Bessel correlation across the desired bandwidth, satisfying FAS requirements. System-level experiments confirm the viability of PRBFN-FAS in practical communication scenarios."}

In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios."}
