However, existing DMs are primarily trained in a\nsupervised manner by using a large corpus of clean images. This reliance on\nclean data poses fundamental challenges in many real-world scenarios, where\nacquiring noise-free data is hard or infeasible, and only noisy and potentially\nincomplete measurements are available. While some methods can train DMs using\nnoisy data, they are generally effective only when the amount of noise is very\nmild or when some additional noise-free data is available. In addition,\nexisting methods for training DMs from incomplete measurements require access\nto multiple complementary acquisition processes, an assumption that poses a\nsignificant practical limitation. Here we introduce the first approach for\nlearning DMs for image restoration using only noisy measurement data from a\nsingle operator. As a first key contribution, we show that DMs, and more\nbroadly minimum mean squared error denoisers, exhibit a weak form of scale\nequivariance linking rescaling in signal amplitude to changes in noise\nintensity. We then leverage this theoretical insight to develop a denoising\nscore-matching strategy that generalizes robustly to noise levels lower than\nthose present in the training data, thereby enabling the learning of DMs from\nnoisy measurements. To further address the challenges of incomplete and noisy\ndata, we integrate our method with equivariant imaging, a complementary\nself-supervised learning framework that exploits the inherent invariants of\nimaging problems, to train DMs for image restoration from single-operator\nmeasurements that are both incomplete and noisy. We validate the effectiveness\nof our approach through extensive experiments on image denoising, demosaicing,\nand inpainting, along with comparisons with the state of the art."}

Recent temporal context mining approaches to\nconditional video coding offer superior coding performance.

Our MH-LVC overcomes this issue by storing multiple\nlong- and short-term reference frames but limiting the number of reference\nframes used at a time for temporal prediction to two. Our decoded frame buffer\nmanagement allows the encoder to flexibly utilize the long-term key frames to\nmitigate temporal cascading errors and the short-term reference frames to\nminimize prediction errors. Moreover, our buffering scheme enables the temporal\nprediction structure to be adapted to individual input videos.

The brain\nage gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's\npredicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The\nresulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with\nrecent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and\nseverity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their\nmethodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical\npopulations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces\na principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in\ngraph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the\nanatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong\ntheoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust\nestimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,\nmachine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path\nforward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research\ndirections in personalized medicine."}

Live streaming requires real-time\nvideo encoding, and hardware video encoders are well suited for such an\nencoding task. In this paper, we introduce a high-level feature model using\nGaussian process regression that can predict the encoding energy of a hardware\nvideo encoder. In an evaluation setup restricted to only P-frames and a single\nkeyframe, the model can predict the encoding energy with a mean absolute\npercentage error of approximately 9%. Further, we demonstrate with an ablation\nstudy that spatial resolution is a key high-level feature for encoding energy\nprediction of a hardware encoder. A practical application of our model is that\nit can be used to perform a prior estimation of the energy required to encode a\nvideo at various spatial resolutions, with different coding standards and codec\npresets."}
