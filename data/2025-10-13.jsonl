Compared to conventional\nCRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not\nrestricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and\ncomprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where\nmultiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target\nscenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid\n(i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center\nof the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA\nrepositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols\nare proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching\nbeamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a\nsingle beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols,\nboth the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the\nmin-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By\nleveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently\nconverted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise\nalgorithm.

Most existing methods adopt the evidence\ndeep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and\ntheoretical robustness.

To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty\nguided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature\nrepresentation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA\nprogressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank\nlearning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for\nchallenging regions.
