Recently proposed supervised machine-learning-enabled reconstruction methods to address these challenges rely on training data and are therefore difficult to generalize across materials systems. We propose a fully self-supervised implicit neural representation (INR) approach using a neural network as a regularizer. Our approach enables fast inline alignment through pose optimization, missing wedge inpainting, and denoising of low dose datasets via model regularization using only a single dataset. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data and show that it produces high-quality tomograms from diverse and information limited datasets. Our results show that INR-based self-supervised reconstructions offer high fidelity reconstructions with minimal user input and preprocessing, and can be readily applied to a wide variety of materials samples and experimental parameters."}

Prior work mitigate this drift with data-specific flows or task-specific adapters that are computationally heavy and not scalable across tasks. This raises the question \"Can't we efficiently manipulate the existing generative capabilities of a flow model?\" To this end, we introduce FlowSteer (FS), an operator-aware conditioning scheme that injects measurement priors along the sampling path,coupling a frozed flow's implicit guidance with explicit measurement constraints. Across super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, and colorization, FS improves measurement consistency and identity preservation in a strictly zero-shot setting-no retrained models, no adapters. We show how the nature of flow models and their sensitivities to noise inform the design of such a scheduler. FlowSteer, although simple, achieves a higher fidelity of reconstructed images, while leveraging the rich generative priors of flow models."}

However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks for safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a plug-and-play and lightweight post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone encoder, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. Hence, it scales to images of varying fields-of-view. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 1,916 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC > 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC > 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches. RF-Deep maintained similar performance consistency across networks of different depths and pretraining strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic approach to enhance the reliability of tumor segmentation from CT volumes."}

Here, we introduce a metasurface-enabled PR (MEPR) concept that integrates a space-time-coding programmable metasurface to imprint distinct spatiotemporal tags onto ambient wireless wavefields. This mechanism transforms a PR into an active-like sensing platform without the need for source control, enabling interference suppression, signal enhancement, and accurate target localization and tracking in cluttered environments. A proof-of-concept implementation operating at 5.48 GHz confirms real-time imaging and tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles under interference-rich conditions, with performance comparable to active radar systems.

The scaling number of recording sites requires complex analog wiring and lead to huge digitization power consumption. Compressive event-based neural frontends have been used in high-density neural implants to support the simultaneous recording of more channels. Event-based frontends (EBF) convert recorded signals into asynchronous digital events via delta modulation and can inherently achieve considerable compression. But EBFs are prone to false events that do not correspond to neural spikes. Spike detection (SPD) is a key process in the iBMI pipeline to detect neural spikes and further reduce the data rate. However, conventional digital SPD suffers from the increasing buffer size and frequent memory access power, and conventional spike emphasizers are not compatible with EBFs. In this work we introduced an event-based spike detection (Ev-SPD) algorithm for scalable compressive EBFs. To implement the algorithm effectively, we proposed a novel low-power 10-T eDRAM-SRAM hybrid random-access memory in-memory computing bitcell for event processing.

This work analyzes how location leakage arises from gradients in a virtual-environment radio map model and proposes a geometry-aligned differential privacy mechanism with heterogeneous noise tailored to both confuse localization and cover gradient spatial patterns. The approach is theoretically supported with a convergence guarantee linking privacy strength to learning accuracy.

To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\\&O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions."}

These gains arise from their inherent operation in the near field (NF) regime, where the spherical nature of the wavefront can no longer be ignored; consequently, characterizing the ambiguity function -- which amounts to the matched beam pattern -- is considerably more challenging. Implementing very wide apertures with half-wavelength element spacing is costly and complex. This motivates thinning the array (removing elements), which introduces intricate aliasing structures, i.e., grating lobes. Whereas prior work has addressed this challenge using approximations tailored to specific array geometries, this paper develops a general framework that reveals the fundamental origins and geometric behavior of grating lobes in near-field ambiguity functions. Using a local spatial-frequency analysis of steering signals, we derive a systematic methodology to model NF grating lobes as aliasing artifacts, quantifying their structure on the AF, and providing design guidelines for XL-arrays that operate within aliasing-safe regions. We further connect our framework to established far-field principles.

Existing studies typically treat these components separately or rely on environment-specific multipath models. In this work, we develop a unified LoS+NLoS channel representation for holographic lines that integrates spatial-sampling-based and expansion-based formulations. Building on this model, we extend the wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) framework, originally introduced for purely LoS channels, to the LoS+NLoS scenario. Applying WDM to the NLoS component yields its angular-domain representation, enabling direct characterization through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further derive closed-form characterizations for isotropic and non-isotropic scattering, with the former recovering Jakes' isotropic model. Lastly, we evaluate the resulting degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity, showing that incorporating the NLoS component substantially improves the performance relative to the purely LoS case."}

We formulate a glitch metric that defines the overall DAC performance, which is then used to find a novel DAC weighting scheme. Numerical simulations show that the proposed architecture can potentially provide a significant performance advantage compared to the segmented structure."}
