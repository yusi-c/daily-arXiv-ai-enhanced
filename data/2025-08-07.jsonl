A main challenge when building a digital\nUE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate\ncomputational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital\ncombining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\\text{r}}$ received\nsignals to $N_{\\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging\nchannel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence\ntime, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale\nfading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading\nrealization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this\nhardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and\ndownlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral\nefficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived.\nThe numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid\nbeamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital\ntransceivers in future systems."}

This study explores the potential of\nmagnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) imaging as a tool for differentiating distal\nAIS from epileptic seizures, a prevalent SM. Using a retrospective dataset of\n162 patients (129 AIS, 33 seizures), we extracted region-wise perfusion map\ndescriptors (PMDs) from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) images.\nStatistical analyses identified several brain regions, located mainly in the\ntemporal and occipital lobe, exhibiting significant group differences in\ncertain PMDs.

The model is lightweight, requiring only\n11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we\nconstructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body\n(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at\ndifferent time points.

Experimental results on the in-house\ndataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in\nmulti-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment\nperformance.

In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading\nRefinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium\nas well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans.
