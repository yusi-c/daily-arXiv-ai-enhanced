Non-Cartesian reconstructions require repeated non-uniform FFTs, and the commonly used Locally Low Rank (LLR) prior adds computational overhead and becomes insufficient at high accelerations. Learned 3D priors could address these limitations, but training them at scale is challenging due to memory and runtime demands. We propose SPUR-iG, a fully 3D deep unrolled subspace reconstruction framework that integrates efficient data consistency with a progressive training strategy. Data consistency leverages implicit GROG, which grids non-Cartesian data onto a Cartesian grid with an implicitly learned kernel, enabling FFT-based updates with minimal artifacts. Training proceeds in three stages: (1) pretraining a denoiser with extensive data augmentation, (2) greedy per-iteration unrolled training, and (3) final fine-tuning with gradient checkpointing. Together, these stages make large-scale 3D unrolled learning feasible within a reasonable compute budget. On a large in vivo dataset with retrospective undersampling, SPUR-iG improves subspace coefficient maps quality and quantitative accuracy at 1-mm isotropic resolution compared with LLR and a hybrid 2D/3D unrolled baseline. Whole-brain reconstructions complete in under 15-seconds, with up to $\\times$111 speedup for 2-minute acquisitions. Notably, $T_1$ maps with our method from 30-second scans achieve accuracy on par with or exceeding LLR reconstructions from 2-minute scans. Overall, the framework improves both accuracy and speed in large-scale 3D MRF reconstruction, enabling efficient and reliable accelerated quantitative imaging."}

While semi-supervised learning (SSL) is commonly used for fetal US image analysis, existing SSL methods typically rely on random limited selection, which can lead to suboptimal model performance by overfitting to homogeneous labeled data. To address this, we propose a two-stage Active Learning (AL) sampler, Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity (EGAD), for fetal head segmentation. Our method first selects the most uncertain samples using predictive entropy, and then refines the final selection using the agreement-diversity score combining cosine similarity and mutual information. Additionally, our SSL framework employs a consistency learning strategy with feature downsampling to further enhance segmentation performance. In experiments, SSL-EGAD achieves an average Dice score of 94.57\\% and 96.32\\% on two public datasets for fetal head segmentation, using 5\\% and 10\\% labeled data for training, respectively. Our method outperforms current SSL models and showcases consistent robustness across diverse pregnancy stage data.

DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms"}

For ultra-high-resolution immersive content such as 8K 360-degree video, this process is computationally intensive due to the large number of representations and the high complexity of modern codecs. This paper investigates fast multirate encoding strategies that reduce encoding time by reusing encoder analysis information across QPs and resolutions. We evaluate two cross-resolution information-reuse pipelines that differ in how reference encodes propagate across resolutions: (i) a strict HD -> 4K -> 8K cascade with scaled analysis reuse, and (ii) a resolution-anchored scheme that initializes each resolution with its own highest-bitrate reference before guiding dependent encodes. In addition to evaluating these pipelines on standard equirectangular projection content, we also apply the same two pipelines to cubemap-projection (CMP) tiling, where each 360-degree frame is partitioned into independently encoded tiles. CMP introduces substantial parallelism, while still benefiting from the proposed multirate analysis-reuse strategies. Experimental results using the SJTU 8K 360-degree dataset show that hierarchical analysis reuse significantly accelerates HEVC encoding with minimal rate-distortion impact across both equirectangular and CMP-tiled content, yielding encoding-time reductions of roughly 33%-59% for ERP and about 51% on average for CMP, with Bjontegaard Delta Encoding Time (BDET) gains approaching -50% and wall-clock speedups of up to 4.2x."}

This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline."}

Existing non-invasive monitoring approaches primarily provide binary blood detection and lack quantitative assessment of bleeding severity or flow dynamic, limiting their ability to support timely clinical decision-making during this high-risk period. In this work, we developed a capsule-sized, multi-wavelength optical sensing wireless platform for order-of-magnitude-level classification of GI bleeding flow rate, leveraging transmission spectroscopy and low-power edge artificial intelligence. The system performs time-resolved, multi-spectral measurements and employs a lightweight two-dimensional convolutional neural network for on-device flow-rate classification, with physics-based validation confirming consistency with wavelength-dependent hemoglobin absorption behavior. In controlled in vitro experiments under simulated gastric conditions, the proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.75% across multiple bleeding flow-rate levels while robustly distinguishing diverse non-blood gastrointestinal interference. By performing embedded inference directly on the capsule electronics, the system reduced overall energy consumption by approximately 88% compared with continuous wireless transmission of raw data, making prolonged, battery-powered operation feasible. Extending capsule-based diagnostics beyond binary blood detection toward continuous, site-specific assessment of bleeding severity, this platform has the potential to support earlier identification of clinically significant rebleeding and inform timely re-intervention during post-endoscopic surveillance."}

This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed.

It is vital to decrease the huge data size before transmitting the Hyperspectral imagery. Besides, large data size leads to processing problems, especially in practical applications. Moreover, due to the lack of sufficient training samples, Hughes phenomena occur with huge amount of data. Feature selection can be used in order to get rid of huge data problems. In this paper, a band selection framework is introduced to reduce the data size and to find out the most proper spectral bands for a specific application. The method is based on finding \"dominant sets\" in hyperspectral data, so that spectral bands are clustered. From each cluster, the band that reflects the cluster behavior the most is selected to form the most valuable band set in the spectra for a specific application. The proposed feature selection method has low computational complexity since it performs on a small size of data when realizing the feature selection. The aim of the study is to find out a general framework that can define required bands for classification without requiring to perform on the whole data set. Results on Pavia and Salinas datasets show that the proposed framework performs better than the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of classification accuracy."}

Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom."}

Falls are among the most critical events to monitor due to their timely response requirement, yet frequent false alarms or uncertain detections can overwhelm caregivers and contribute to alarm fatigue. This motivates the design of reliable, whole end-to-end ambient monitoring systems from occupancy and activity awareness to fall and post-fall detection. In this paper, we focus on robust post-fall floor-occupancy detection using an off-the-shelf 60 GHz FMCW radar and evaluate its deployment in a realistic, furnished indoor environment representative of LTC facilities. Post-fall detection is challenging since motion is minimal, and reflections from the floor and surrounding objects can dominate the radar signal return. We compare a vendor-provided digital beamforming (DBF) pipeline against a proposed preprocessing approach based on Capon or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector is applied and evaluated on the resulting range-azimuth maps across 7 participants.

We present Respiratory-Amplification Semi-Static Occupancy (RASSO), an invertible Doppler-domain non-linear remapping that densifies the slow-time FFT (Doppler) grid around 0 m/s before adaptive Capon beamforming. The resulting range-azimuth (RA) maps exhibit higher effective SNR, sharper target peaks, and lower background variance, making thresholding and learning more reliable. On a real nursing-home dataset collected with a short-range 1Tx-3Rx radar, RASSO-RA improves classical detection performance, achieving AUC = 0.981 and recall = 0.920/0.947 at FAR = 1%/5%, outperforming conventional Capon processing and a recent baseline. RASSO-RA also benefits data-driven models: a frame-based CNN reaches 95-99% accuracy and a sequence-based CNN-LSTM reaches 99.4-99.6% accuracy across subjects. A paired session-level bootstrap test confirms statistically significant macro-F1 gains of 2.6-3.6 points (95% confidence intervals above zero) over the non-warped pipeline.

To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-aware model division multiple access (S-MDMA) framework tailored for bandwidth-limited multi-user scenarios. The proposed framework first performs semantic extraction and merging based on the MDMA architecture to consolidate redundant information. To further improve transmission efficiency, a semantic sensitivity sorting algorithm is presented, which can selectively retain key semantic features. In addition, to mitigate inter-user interference, the framework incorporates orthogonal embedding of semantic features and introduces a multi-user reconstruction loss function to guide joint optimization.

In the second scenario, the objective is to maximize the minimum beam gain among all the above directions. However, both problems are non-convex and challenging to solve optimally. To gain insights, we first analyze several special cases and show that, with proper positioning of the MAs, directing the beam toward a specific direction can lead to nulls or full gains in other directions in the two scenarios, respectively. For the general cases, we propose a discrete sampling method and an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions to the two formulated problems. Furthermore, considering the practical limitations in antenna positioning accuracy, we analyze the impact of position errors on the performance of the optimized beamforming and MA positions, by introducing a Taylor series approximation for the near-field beam gain at each target. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms."}

This paper proposes a lightweight simulation-to-real (sim2real) framework that enables reliable Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar occupancy detection and people counting using only a physics-informed geometric simulator and a small unlabeled real calibration set. We introduce calibrated domain randomization (CDR) to align the global noise-floor statistics of simulated range-Doppler (RD) maps with those observed in real environments while preserving discriminative micro-Doppler structure. Across real-world evaluations, ResNet18 models trained purely on CDR-adjusted simulation achieve 97 percent accuracy for occupancy detection and 72 percent accuracy for people counting, outperforming ray-tracing baseline simulation and conventional random domain randomization baselines."}

A non-orthogonal pilot transmission scheme is considered to accommodate a larger number of users that can be supported by ELAA systems without incurring an excessive amount of training overhead. To facilitate efficient multi-user channel estimation, we express the received signal as a third-order low-rank tensor, which admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios and a block term decomposition (BTD) model for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. An alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-linear least squares (NLS) algorithm are employed to perform CPD and BTD, respectively. Channel parameters are then efficiently extracted from the recovered factor matrices. By exploiting the geometry of the propagation paths in the estimated channel, users' positions can be precisely determined in LoS scenarios. Moreover, our uniqueness analysis shows that the proposed tensor-based joint multi-user channel estimation framework is effective even when the number of pilot symbols is much smaller than the number of users, revealing its potential in training overhead reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves markedly higher channel estimation accuracy than compressed sensing (CS)-based approaches."}

However, jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming with the HRIS reflection and amplification coefficients to maximize spectral efficiency (SE) is a non-convex problem, and conventional iterative solutions are computationally intensive. To address this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns a direct mapping from channel state information to the near-optimal transmit beamforming and HRIS configurations. The DRL model is trained offline, after which it can compute the beamforming and HRIS configurations with low complexity and latency. Simulation results demonstrate that our DRL-based method achieves 95% of the SE obtained by the alternating optimization benchmark, while significantly lowering the computational complexity."}

Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability."}

In practice, large contiguous bandwidths are difficult to obtain due to hardware constraints and spectrum fragmentation. Aggregating non-contiguous narrow bands can increase the effective frequency span, but a non-contiguous frequency layout introduces challenges such as elevated sidelobes and ambiguity in delay estimation. This paper introduces a point-spread-function (PSF)-centric framework for dual-band OFDM delay estimation. We model the observed delay profile as the convolution of the true target response with a PSF determined by the dual-band subcarrier selection pattern, explicitly linking band configuration to resolution and ambiguity. To suppress PSF-induced artifacts, we adapt the RELAX algorithm for dual-band multi-target delay estimation. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy in dual-band scenarios, supporting ILC under fragmented spectrum."}

Nevertheless, their specific impact on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains largely unexplored. In HRF systems, where uplink (UL) paths carry direct and reflected signals in the same frequency band, the reflected signal is often significantly weaker, making HRF performance particularly sensitive to ADC resolution. To study this effect, we use the quantized Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) to measure sensing accuracy. This work derives an upper bound on the quantized CRB for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and explores CRB-rate trade-offs through two formulated optimization problems. Simulation results indicate that HRF becomes infeasible when the dynamic range of the received signal exceeds the dynamic range supported by the ADC, which is inherently limited by its resolution. Furthermore, the UL communication rate does not increase significantly when the ADC resolution is raised beyond a certain threshold. These observations highlight a fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication performance: while HRF performance benefits from higher ADC resolutions, the corresponding gains in communication rate plateau. This trade-off is effectively characterized using CRB-rate boundaries derived through simulation."}

Our proposed scheme is mostly signal-agnostic and therefore can be applied to a wide range of possible ICAS signals. We also mitigate the effect of finite sampling frequencies, which otherwise would degrade the synchronization and localization performance severely."}

Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities.
