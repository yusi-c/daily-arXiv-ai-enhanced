However, existing models empirically apply fixed\nthresholds (e.g., 0.5) to differentiate lesions from the background, offering\nno statistical guarantees on key metrics such as the false negative rate (FNR).\nThis lack of principled risk control undermines their reliable deployment in\nhigh-stakes clinical applications, especially in challenging scenarios like 3D\nlesion segmentation (3D-LS). To address this issue, we propose a\nrisk-constrained framework, termed Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), that\ncalibrates data-driven thresholds via conformalization to ensure the test-time\nFNR remains below a target tolerance $\\varepsilon$ under desired risk levels.\nCLS begins by holding out a calibration set to analyze the threshold setting\nfor each sample under the FNR tolerance, drawing on the idea of conformal\nprediction. We define an FNR-specific loss function and identify the critical\nthreshold at which each calibration data point just satisfies the target\ntolerance. Given a user-specified risk level $\\alpha$, we then determine the\napproximate $1-\\alpha$ quantile of all the critical thresholds in the\ncalibration set as the test-time confidence threshold. By conformalizing such\ncritical thresholds, CLS generalizes the statistical regularities observed in\nthe calibration set to new test data, providing rigorous FNR constraint while\nyielding more precise and reliable segmentations.

This paper compares the\nperformance of Fragmentation based MAC (FROG-MAC) against Fuzzy Priority\nScheduling based MAC (FPS-MAC), both of which have been designed to optimize\nthe performance of heterogenous wireless networks. Contiki has been used as a\nsimulation platform and a single hop star topology has been assumed to resemble\nthe industrial environment. It has been shown that FROG-MAC has the potential\nto outperform FPS-MAC in terms of energy efficiency and delay both, due to its\ninherent feature of interrupting ongoing lower priority transmission on the\nchannel."}

Conference on Networking and Services (ICNS 2025). Lisbon,\n  Portugal", "summary": "Simulation studies are conducted at different levels of details for assessing\nthe performance of Media Access Control (MAC) protocols in Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSN). In the present-day scenario where hundreds of MAC protocols\nhave been proposed, it is important to assess the quality of performance\nevaluation being conducted for each of the proposed protocols. It therefore\nbecomes crucial to compare the results of high-level theoretical simulations\nwith the detailed implementation results before any network protocol could be\ndeployed for a real-world scenario. In this work, we present a comparison of\nhigh-level theoretical and detailed implementation results for Adaptive and\nDynamic Polling-MAC (ADP-MAC). MATLAB has been used for conducting initial\ntheoretical simulations and TinyOS has been used to develop the detailed\nimplementation of protocol for Mica2 platform. Performance evaluation of\nADP-MAC using the two levels of simulation has been conducted based on energy\nand delay. In the high-level implementation, energy consumption was found to be\ndecreasing whereas delay was found to be increasing for increasing channel\npolling intervals. On the other hand, when detailed implementation was\ndeveloped, it was observed that both energy consumption and delay revealed an\nincreasing trend with the increasing polling intervals. Therefore, it has been\nshown that the trends for high- and low-level simulations for ADP-MAC are\nsignificantly different, due to the lack of realistic assumptions in the\nhigher-level study."}

Eldar"], "title": "mSQUID: Model-Based Leanred Modulo Recovery at Low Sampling Rates", "comment": null, "summary": "Modulo sampling enables acquisition of signals with unlimited dynamic range\nby folding the input into a bounded interval prior to sampling, thus\neliminating the risk of signal clipping and preserving information without\nrequiring highresolution ADCs. While this enables low-cost hardware, the\nnonlinear distortion introduced by folding presents recovery challenges,\nparticularly under noise and quantization. We propose a model-based deep\nunfolding network tailored to this setting, combining the interpretability of\nclassical compress sensing (CS) solvers with the flexibility of learning. A key\ninnovation is a soft-quantization module that encodes the modulo prior by\nguiding the solution toward discrete multiples of the folding range in a\ndifferentiable and learnable way. Our method, modulo soft-quantized unfolded\niterative decoder (mSQUID), achieves superior reconstruction performance at low\nsampling rates under additive Gaussian noise. We further demonstrate its\nutility in a challenging case where signals with vastly different amplitudes\nand disjoint frequency bands are acquired simultaneously and quantized. In this\nscenario, classical sampling often struggles due to weak signal distortion or\nstrong signal clipping, while our approach is able to recover the input\nsignals. Our method also offers significantly reduced runtimes, making it\nsuitable for real-time, resource-limited systems."}

To overcome this\nchallenge, this article proposes wireless-fed pinchingantenna systems\n(Wi-PASS), which employ wireless feeding to energize waveguides. Wi-PASS offer\na practical and cost-efficient means to extend coverage beyond the BS vicinity.\nSeveral indoor and outdoor use cases demonstrate Wi-PASS advantages over PASS.\nNumerical results further show that Wi-PASS deliver higher data rates than\nconventional fixed-antenna systems, confirming the superior feasibility and\nperformance of Wi-PASS.

A naive approach requires\naugmenting the dataset with many rotated copies of each sample, incurring\nprohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we extend PCA to 3D volumetric\ndatasets with unknown orientations by developing an efficient and principled\nframework for SO(3)-invariant PCA that implicitly accounts for all rotations\nwithout explicit data augmentation. By exploiting underlying algebraic\nstructure, we demonstrate that the computation involves only the square root of\nthe total number of covariance entries, resulting in a substantial reduction in\ncomplexity.
