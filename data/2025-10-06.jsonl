Though treatments, such as\nanti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the\ndegenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision\nloss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD\nor AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to\nreduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,\ndeep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and\nGradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in\ndistinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI\ndriven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists\nregarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works\nmostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying\ncausal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific\nfactors or even lead to less reliable decisions.

Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall\nNano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an\naltitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands\nspanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and\nmosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point\nEmpirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC\nspectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE\nvalues below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm\nrange, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside\nraw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support\nreproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access\nUAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor\nbenchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic\ninduction (EMI) data from the same test field."}
