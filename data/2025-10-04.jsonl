While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper\ninvestigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system.\nThis problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat\nnature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions\nacross different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the\nmovement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the\ncontinuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection\nproblem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient\npartial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a\nbranch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to\neffectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nregime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the\noptimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results\nreveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position\nantennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can\nachieve near-optimal performance."}

However, existing mathematical\nnoise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive\nnoise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the\nnoise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of\npractically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the\nstatistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise\nvia the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC\nmodem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches\nbased on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the\nlength of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate\ncyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss\nfunction to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training\ndataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various\napplications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based\nmodels based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform\nquantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a\npiecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a\nfrequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC\nsystems.

Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of\nits spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This\nstrategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no\ndata can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by\nsmart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase\nor that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To\naddress these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection\n(JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to\nestimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the\nlegitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need\nfor a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate\nsmart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms,\nSANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the\nlegitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation."}

In the\nSE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a\ncodebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of\napplying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach\nprovides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum\nefficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of\nreliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast\ntime-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized\neavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying\nparameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design.

To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous\noperators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is\ndeveloped.

Sensing parameters are embedded within the\ntarget-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing\neavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory\ninformation without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure\ntarget detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating\nunauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By\nintroducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC\nsignals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which\nincrease its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing\nreceiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering,\nalbeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM\nsignal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape\nthe secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead\nEve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify\nthe sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated\nsidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way\ntrade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security,\nhighlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system\nperformance.
