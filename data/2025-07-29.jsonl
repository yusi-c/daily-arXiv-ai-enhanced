Therefore, accurately\ndetermining the estrous cycle is crucial for minimizing interference. Manually\nidentifying the estrous cycle in rats presents several challenges, including\nhigh costs, long training periods, and subjectivity. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes a classification network-Spatial Long-distance EfficientNet\n(SLENet). This network is designed based on EfficientNet, specifically\nmodifying the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution (MBConv) module by\nintroducing a novel Spatial Efficient Channel Attention (SECA) mechanism to\nreplace the original Squeeze Excitation (SE) module. Additionally, a Non-local\nattention mechanism is incorporated after the last convolutional layer to\nenhance the network's ability to capture long-range dependencies. The dataset\nused 2,655 microscopic images of rat vaginal epithelial cells, with 531 images\nin the test set.

The proposed method uses a single\nsnapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is\nrooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The\nmethod involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a\nlow-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect\nthe sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output\nthrough completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs\nfrom the restored uniform linear array samples.\n  We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the\nrequired sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation.\nWe demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a\nnear-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's\ndegree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic\nfactors.

To overcome these limitations, we propose\nNeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded\nEEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy.

While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC\nlinks, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G)\ntechnologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major\nproblem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference\nsources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link\nquality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air\nthan the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with\na larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the\nasymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first\nconducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural\nareas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show\nthat the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to\n170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a\nresult of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request\n(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To\ninvestigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with\nno combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental\nredundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact\nof asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three\nsteps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH)\nthroughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical\nUL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL\nthroughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission."}

However,\ntheir practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges:\ndegradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the\ncomputational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This\npaper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated\nextreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation\nframework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network\ncontains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this\nfield to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each\nsample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance\ncorresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending\nup to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the\nproposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used\nhere to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows\nfor time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and\nboosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental\nconditions.
