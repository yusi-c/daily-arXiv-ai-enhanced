Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable\ncontinuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising\nstrategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,\nmonitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise\nthe signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe\nartifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer\ninterpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study\nproposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition\nand deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to\nintegrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,\nimproving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model\nencodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of\nkernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained\nfor denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model\nfrom the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily\nactivities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep\nlearning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,\non average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB\nand reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA\ndataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and\ncomparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively\nenhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the\nextraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools\nfor monitoring cardiovascular diseases."}

This paper addresses the challenge\nof direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and\nnon-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA\nstructures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a\nfully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture,\nwhereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed\nreference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal\ncovariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited\nsample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA\nestimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix\nreconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for\nNARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses.\nBoth methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational\ncomplexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and\nextensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve\nunderdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform\nconventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce\ncomputational complexity."}

By\ningeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the\nproposed architectures achieve an extended range of spatial degrees of freedom\n(DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This\ninnovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution\nDOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing\nmore sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two\nbespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with\naligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a\nhardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by\nintricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric,\nclosed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for\nprecise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding\nprocedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by\nsimplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy.

In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna\nsystem (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to\noptimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,\nwe develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial\ngeometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for\ninitial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs\nan expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed\napproach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to\nclassify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high\nlocalization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model\nsimplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based\nsource localization.

However,\ncommercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive\nbehavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly\nmolecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this\ngap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general\nnon-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate\nmaximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce\nan algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX\ncharacteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through\nsimulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS\nsensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves\nsimilar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large\nnumbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms\nmethods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed\ndetector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical\nsensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC."}
