However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance."}

We propose a new dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with a frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module, explicitly bridging spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity. In this structure, the ViT backbone captures local and global dependencies, while the FFT-ReLU component enforces frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur-related artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Both quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations confirm its effectiveness, establishing a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration."}

However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \\textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening."}

This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance."}

While recent advances have made efforts in architectural refinements to improve representational capability, these methods typically involve complex designs, which may incur increased computational overhead and lack the flexibility to integrate into other frameworks. Moreover, the inherent limitation in model capacity restricts the expressiveness of NVR networks, resulting in a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, we propose Online-RepNeRV, a NVR framework based on online structural reparameterization. Specifically, we propose a universal reparameterization block named ERB, which incorporates multiple parallel convolutional paths to enhance the model capacity. To mitigate the overhead, an online reparameterization strategy is adopted to dynamically fuse the parameters during training, and the multi-branch structure is equivalently converted into a single-branch structure after training. As a result, the additional computational and parameter complexity is confined to the encoding stage, without affecting the decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments on mainstream video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an average PSNR gain of 0.37-2.7 dB over baseline methods, while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed."}

To accelerate CMR imaging, various methods have been proposed to recover high-quality spatiotemporal CMR images from highly undersampled k-t space data.

In this work, we proposed MoCo-INR, a new unsupervised method that integrates implicit neural representations (INR) with the conventional motion-compensated (MoCo) framework. Using explicit motion modeling and the continuous prior of INRs, MoCo-INR can produce accurate cardiac motion decomposition and high-quality CMR reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a new INR network architecture tailored to the CMR problem, which significantly stabilizes model optimization. Experiments on retrospective (simulated) datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoCo-INR over state-of-the-art methods, achieving fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at ultra-high acceleration factors (e.g., 20x in VISTA sampling). Additionally, evaluations on prospective (real-acquired) free-breathing CMR scans highlight the clinical practicality of MoCo-INR for real-time imaging. Several ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the critical components of MoCo-INR."}

To address the increased decision complexity resulting from a larger number of constellation points, a dimension reduction (DR) technique is introduced, allowing the derivation of closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expressions under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions.

By activating pinching antennas (PAs) near both receivers and flexibly adjusting PAs' power radiation ratios, both energy harvesting efficiency and communication quality can be enhanced. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems.
