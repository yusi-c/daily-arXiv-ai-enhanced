Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is\nessential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation. Traditional\nin situ measurements are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based\napproaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable, long-term, and\ntransferable monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll\nmonitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage,\nby developing a reliable methodology to predict and map Chl-a across the water\ncolumn of the Mar Menor. The work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based\nground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific\nmonitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Nearly a\ndecade of Sentinel 2 images was atmospherically corrected using C2RCC\nprocessors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m, 3-4 m).\nMultiple ML and DL algorithms-including RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, Multilater\nPerceptron Networks, and ensembles-were trained and validated using\ncross-validation. Systematic band-combination experiments and spatial\naggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. Results show\ndepth-dependent performance. At the surface, C2X-Complex with XGBoost and\nensemble models achieved R2 = 0.89; at 1-2 m, CatBoost and ensemble models\nreached R2 = 0.87; at 2-3 m, TOA reflectances with KNN performed best (R2 =\n0.81); while at 3-4 m, RF achieved R2 = 0.66. Generated maps successfully\nreproduced known eutrophication events (e.g., 2016 crisis, 2025 surge),\nconfirming robustness. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology\nfor depth-specific Chl-amapping. Its integration of multispectral band\ncombinations, buoy calibration, and ML/DL modeling offers a transferable\nframework for other turbid coastal systems."}

In this paper, inspired by\nthe success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video\nCompression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression.\nGLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a\nperceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints\nfrom the rate-distortion optimization.

We assess its performance in terms of the root\nmean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without\ncalibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within\nBayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation."}

While these frequency\nbands offer abundant spectrum, they also pose severe propagation and hardware\ndesign challenges, motivating the search for alternative antenna solutions\nbeyond conventional antenna arrays. Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) have emerged as\na promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure,\nlow fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables\nfrequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we\nreview the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique\nproperties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz\nwireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that\nLWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and\naccurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key\nopen challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing,\ninformation theory, standardization, and hardware implementation, that need to\nbe addressed to fully harness LWAs as a cost-effective and scalable enabler of\nnext generations of wireless systems."}
