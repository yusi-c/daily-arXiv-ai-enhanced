We\npropose a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray\nimages which are extracted from two X-ray videos captured at different C-arm\nangles. The proposed framework consists of three main components: image\nsegmentation, motion phase matching, and 3D reconstruction. An automatic video\nsegmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for\nimage segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase\nmatching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar\nrespiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction.\nThis is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead\nwithin the X-ray video. The semantic segmentation approach assigns different\nlabels to different object classes enabling accurate differentiation between\nblood vessels, balloons, and catheters. Once a suitable image pair is selected,\nkey anatomical landmarks (vessel branching points and endpoints) are matched\nbetween the two views using a heuristic method that minimizes reconstruction\nerrors. This is followed by a novel geometric reconstruction algorithm to\ngenerate the 3D vessel tree. The algorithm computes the 3D vessel centrelines\nby determining the intersection of two 3D surfaces. Compared to traditional\nmethods based on epipolar constraints, the proposed approach simplifies there\nconstruction workflow and improves overall accuracy. We trained and validated\nour segmentation method on 62 X-ray angiography video sequences. On the test\nset, our method achieved a segmentation accuracy of 0.703. The 3D\nreconstruction framework was validated by measuring the reconstruction error of\nkey anatomical landmarks, achieving a reprojection errors of 0.62mm +/- 0.38mm."}

In these configurations, the\nsystem achieves a coherent gain over an incoherent network of N nodes,\nsignificantly improving the relevant signal power ratios. Our system\ndemonstrates extended array phase coherence times, enabling advanced\ntechniques. Results from over-the-air experiments demonstrate a 14.3 dB\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise improvement in interference-laden scenarios\nwith a contributing 13.5 dB null towards interference in receive beamforming.\nIn transmit nulling, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 7.9 dB is measured\ntowards an intended receiver while maintaining an SNR reduction of 8.9 dB at\nanother receiver. These findings represent the use of distributed coherence in\nthe V band without the use of GPS timing."}

A critical\nchallenge is the estimation of the cascaded base station (BS)-RIS-user channel,\nsince the passive nature of RIS elements prevents direct channel acquisition,\nincurring prohibitive pilot overhead, computational complexity, and energy\nconsumption. To address this, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based channel\nestimation framework that reduces pilot overhead by grouping RIS elements and\nreconstructing the cascaded channel from partial pilot observations.\nFurthermore, conventional DL models trained under single-user settings suffer\nfrom poor generalization across new user locations and propagation scenarios.\nWe develop a distributed machine learning (DML) strategy in which the BS and\nusers collaboratively train a shared neural network using diverse channel\ndatasets collected across the network, thereby achieving robust generalization.\nBuilding on this foundation, we design a hierarchical DML neural architecture\nthat first classifies propagation conditions and then employs scenario-specific\nfeature extraction to further improve estimation accuracy. Simulation results\nconfirm that the proposed framework substantially reduces pilot overhead and\ncomplexity while outperforming conventional methods and single-user models in\nchannel estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the practicality and\neffectiveness of the proposed approach for 6G RIS-assisted systems."}

This paper considers the case\nwhere, at each observation time, the decision-maker needs to choose between\nmultiple experiments with different information qualities and costs.

An algorithm called the 2E-CUSUM Algorithm has been\ndeveloped to achieve this goal for the two-experiment case. Extensions to\nmultiple-experiment designs are also studied, and 2E-CUSUM is extended\naccordingly. Data efficiency, where the observer has the choice not to perform\nan experiment, is explored as well. The proposed algorithms are analyzed and\nshown to be asymptotically optimal."}
