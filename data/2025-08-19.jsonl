However, its high\nreceiver-side computational complexity remains a major barrier to practical\ndeployment. To address this, we propose a novel symbol-level precoding\n(SLP)-based AFDM transmission framework, which shifts the signal processing\nburden in downlink communications from user side to the base station (BS),\nenabling direct symbol detection without requiring channel estimation or\nequalization at the receiver. Specifically, in the uplink phase, we propose a\nSparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) based channel estimation algorithm by exploiting\nthe inherent sparsity of affine frequency (AF) domain channels. In particular,\nthe sparse prior is modeled via a hierarchical Laplace distribution, and\nparameters are iteratively updated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. We also derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) to characterize\nthe theoretical performance limit. In the downlink phase, the BS employs the\nSLP technology to design the transmitted waveform based on the estimated uplink\nchannel state information (CSI) and channel reciprocity. The resulting\noptimization problem is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP)\nproblem, and its dual problem is investigated by Lagrangian function and\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nSBL estimator outperforms traditional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) in\naccuracy and robustness to off-grid effects, while the SLP-based waveform\ndesign scheme achieves performance comparable to conventional AFDM receivers\nwhile significantly reducing the computational complexity at receiver,\nvalidating the practicality of our approach."}

In particular, we aim to jointly design the polarization and\nbeamforming vectors on both transceivers for simultaneous channel\nreconfiguration and beam alignment, which remarkably enhance the beamforming\ngain. However, joint optimization over polarization and beamforming vectors\nwithout channel state information (CSI) is a challenging task, since\ndepolarization increases the channel dimension; whereas massive MIMO systems\ntypically have low-dimensional pilot measurement from limited radio frequency\n(RF) chain.
