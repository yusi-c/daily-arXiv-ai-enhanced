However, existing methods often treat heartbeats as homogeneous signals, overlooking the phase-specific characteristics within the cardiac cycle. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Phase-Aware Fusion~(HPAF) framework that explicitly avoids cross-feature entanglement through a three-stage design. In the first stage, Intra-Phase Representation (IPR) independently extracts representations for each cardiac phase, ensuring that phase-specific morphological and variation cues are preserved without interference from other phases. In the second stage, Phase-Grouped Hierarchical Fusion (PGHF) aggregates physiologically related phases in a structured manner, enabling reliable integration of complementary phase information. In the final stage, Global Representation Fusion (GRF) further combines the grouped representations and adaptively balances their contributions to produce a unified and discriminative identity representation. Moreover, considering ECG signals are continuously acquired, multiple heartbeats can be collected for each individual. We propose a Heartbeat-Aware Multi-prototype (HAM) enrollment strategy, which constructs a multi-prototype gallery template set to reduce the impact of heartbeat-specific noise and variability. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HPAF achieves state-of-the-art results in the comparison with other methods under both closed and open-set settings."}

Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction framework (PnP-MBIR) that integrates a deep convolutional denoiser trained in a 2-stage self-supervised Noise-to-Noise (N2N) scheme. The method alternates between enforcing sinogram-domain data fidelity and applying the learned image-domain denoiser within an optimization, enabling artifact suppression while maintaining anatomical structure. The 2-stage protocol enables fully self-supervised training from noisy data, followed by high-dose fine-tuning, ensuring the denoiser's robustness in the ultra-low-dose regime. Our method enables high-quality reconstructions at $\\sim$70--80\\% lower dose levels, while maintaining diagnostic fidelity comparable to standard full-dose scans. Quantitative evaluations using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features -- including contrast, homogeneity, entropy, and correlation -- confirm that the proposed method yields superior texture consistency and detail preservation over standalone deep learning and supervised PnP baselines. Qualitative and quantitative results on both simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces streaks and structured artifacts while preserving subtle tissue contrast, making it a promising tool for ULDCT reconstruction."}

We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents.

In this work, we propose an attention-based knowledge distillation (KD) framework, termed KDPhys, for extracting rPPG signals from facial video sequences. The proposed method distills global temporal representations from a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher model to a lightweight 2D CNN student model through effective 3D-to-2D feature distillation.

Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation. Key insights and takeaways from these methods are summarized. Given the promise of AI-driven methods in meeting performance requirements, we also examine the open-source channel datasets and simulators that could be used to train high-performance AI-driven CSI extrapolation models.

Multiply-accumulate~(MAC) is considered a {\\textit de facto} unit operation in NNs. By leveraging the inherent parallel processing capabilities of CiM, NNs that require numerous MAC operations can be executed more efficiently. This is further facilitated by storing the weights in SRAM, reducing the need for extensive data movement and enhancing overall computational speed and efficiency. Traditional CiM architectures execute MAC operations in the analog domain, employing an Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) to convert the analog MAC values into digital outputs. However, these ADCs introduce significant increase in area and power consumption, as well as introduce non-linearities. This work proposes a resonant time-domain compute-in-memory (TDC-CiM) architecture that eliminates the need for an ADC by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to digitize analog MAC results with lower power and area cost. A dedicated 8T SRAM cell enables reliable bitwise MAC operations, while the readout uses a 4-bit TDC with pulse-shrinking delay elements, achieving 1 GS/s sampling with a power consumption of only 1.25 mW. In addition, a weight stationary data mapping strategy combined with an automated SRAM macro selection algorithm enables scalable and energy-efficient deployment across CNN workloads. Evaluation across six CNN models shows that the algorithm reduces inference energy consumption by up to 8x when scaling SRAM size from 32~KB to 256~KB, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss after quantization. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is validated on an 8~KB SRAM memory array using TSMC 28~nm technology.

For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform."}

Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, typically requiring matrix inversion at every iteration. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient optimization framework based on fractional programming (FP). Our key idea is to reformulate the KLD maximization problem into a sequence of tractable quadratic subproblems using matrix FP. To further reduce complexity, we introduce a nonhomogeneous relaxation technique that replaces the costly linear system solver with a simple closed-form update, thereby reducing the per-iteration complexity to quadratic order. To compensate for the convergence speed trade-off caused by relaxation, we employ an acceleration method called STEM by interpreting the iterative scheme as a fixed-point mapping. The resulting algorithm achieves significantly faster convergence rates with low per-iteration cost. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach reduces the total runtime by orders of magnitude compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark.
