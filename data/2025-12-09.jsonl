This paper evaluates strong data augmentation, one of the most important components for self-supervised contrastive learning's improved performance. Strong data augmentation involves applying the composition of multiple augmentation techniques on images. Surprisingly, we find that the existing data augmentations do not always improve performance for semantic segmentation for medical images. We experiment with other augmentations that provide improved performance."}

And any comment is welcome", "summary": "Temporal single-photon (TSP-) LiDAR presents a promising solution for imaging-free target recognition over long distances with reduced size, cost, and power consumption. However, existing TSP-LiDAR approaches are ineffective in handling open-set scenarios where unknown targets emerge, and they suffer significant performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and short acquisition times (fewer photons). Here, inspired by semantic communication, we propose a semantic TSP-LiDAR based on a self-updating semantic knowledge base (SKB), in which the target recognition processing of TSP-LiDAR is formulated as a semantic communication. The results, both simulation and experiment, demonstrate that our approach surpasses conventional methods, particularly under challenging conditions of low SNR and limited acquisition time. More importantly, our self-updating SKB mechanism can dynamically update the semantic features of newly encountered targets in the SKB, enabling continuous adaptation without the need for extensive retraining of the neural network. In fact, a recognition accuracy of 89% is achieved on nine types of unknown targets in real-world experiments, compared to 66% without the updating mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for adaptive and robust target recognition in complex and dynamic environments."}

Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician\" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \\textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models."}

Linear subspaces have emerged as a suitable model for tile clusters; however, they are not well matched to images patches given that images are non-negative and thus not distributed around the origin in the tile vector space. We study the use of affine subspace models for the clusters to better match the geometric structure of the image tile vector space. We also present a simple denoising algorithm that relies on the affine subspace clustering model using least squares projection. We review several algorithmic approaches to solve the affine subspace clustering problem and show experimental results that highlight the performance improvements in clustering and denoising."}

For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting."}

We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$.

Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing."}

In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations."}

Building on the principle of energy concentration in beamspace, we introduce a tiled windowed-beamspace MVDR framework that distributes spatial FFT processing across subarrays while performing joint beamforming in a compact global beamspace domain. Each tile applies a 2D spatial DFT followed by an angle-of-arrival dependent beamspace window, producing a reduced-dimensional representation that preserves the dominant spatial structure of the received signal. The windowed outputs from the tiles are concatenated and processed by a centralized MVDR beamformer, enabling coherent full-aperture processing with drastically reduced dimensionality. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves detection and interference suppression performance comparable to full-dimensional processing, while substantially lowering computational cost, memory usage, and training requirements.

Due to mutual coupling, the mapping from load configuration to observed fields is fundamentally non-linear, which complicates the analysis of BS-EEMDOFs. We introduce a definition of BS-EEMDOFs based on the Jacobian of the observed fields with respect to the load configuration. We derive a closed-form expression from multiport network theory which demonstrates that the number of BS-EEMDOFs is fundamentally a distributed variable, whose distribution depends on the mutual coupling between the backscatter elements and the coherent illumination. The modes associated with BS-EEMDOFs lie in the column space of the end-to-end channel matrix from backscatter array ports to receiver ports, but the number of BS-EEMDOFs is generally different from the number of benchmark EEMDOFs associated with the same array being coherently fed rather than tunably terminated.

Existing approaches face fundamental trade-offs: magnetic-based methods (NFC/NFMI) achieve low power but are limited to sub-megabit rates, while millimeter-wave techniques provide gigabits/sec connectivity at higher power consumption and only centimeter-scale ranges. We demonstrate that near-field electric (NFE) communication breaks this trade-off via capacitive coupling enabled by confined electric fields. NFE simultaneously achieves ultra-low power ($<$1 mW per transceiver), high-speed data throughput ($>$3 Mbps), and configurable decimeter-range (5-30 cm) capabilities previously considered mutually exclusive. Systematic measurements across multiple orientations and configurations show NFE can support decimeter communication coverage. The power consumption of 0.4 mW at the transmitter (Tx) and 0.6 mW at the receiver (Rx), when combined is up to $\\sim$24$\\times$ lower than NFC and $\\sim$3$\\times$ lower than NFMI while achieving significantly higher data rates, and a couple of orders of magnitude lower power than mm-wave based technique. Testing with symmetrical electrodes across eight orientations validated consistent performance and robustness for practical deployments. Extended-range experiments achieved stable 2 Mbps throughput at 3.5 meters using conductive media, demonstrating NFE's unique ability to leverage environmental conductors. Optimized device design can facilitate achieving an extended range for Body-assisted NFE up to 1 m. Results establish NFE as foundational for next-generation wireless applications where security, low power, and throughput converge, enabling dense IoT deployments, secure payment systems, and high-speed device-to-device communication previously limited by the power-performance trade-off."}

The observed data follow a linear structural vector autoregressive model (SVARM) with both instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies, where the instantaneous structure is modeled by a DAG to reflect potential causal relationships. While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives."}

In QGT, the objective is to identify a small subset of defective items among $N$ candidates using only $M \\ll N$ pooled tests, each reporting the number of defectives in the tested subset. We train a multi-layer perceptron to map noisy measurement vectors to binary defect indicators, achieving accurate and robust recovery even under sparse, bounded perturbations. Beyond accuracy, we show that the trained network implicitly learns the underlying pooling structure that links items to tests, allowing this structure to be recovered directly from the network's Jacobian. This indicates that the model does not merely memorize training patterns but internalizes the true combinatorial relationships governing QGT. Our findings reveal that standard feedforward architectures can learn verifiable inverse mappings in structured combinatorial recovery problems."}

In order to realize XL-MIMO costeffectively, an innovative ray antenna array (RAA) architecture with directly-connected uniform linear array (ULA) was recently proposed, which achieves flexible beamforming without relying on traditional analog phase shifters or digital beamforming. However, RAA suffers from the signal blockage issue since its ray-configured ULAs are placed in the same plane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel antenna array architecture termed cylinder directly-connected antenna array (DCAA), which is achieved via multiple simple uniform circular array (sUCA) with carefully designed orientations in a layered three-dimensional structure. The so-called sUCA partitions the uniform circular array (UCA) into two sub-arrays where each sub-array has all antenna elements directly connected to achieve a desired beam direction corresponding to the sub-array's physical orientation, thus achieving full spatial coverage. Compared with the conventional ULA architecture with hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed cylinder DCAA can achieve uniform spatial resolution, enhanced communication rate and lower hardware costs. Simulation results are provided to validate the promised gains of cylinder DCAA, demonstrating its great potential for high-frequency systems such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) systems."}

A UAV-mounted RIS enables directional alignment to serve ground users in scenarios where the direct Base Station (BS)-to-user path is blocked. Using the SimRIS channel simulator, we analyze the system under various rotation angles and present performance heatmaps that highlight optimal RIS orientations. The study shows that RIS alignment has a substantial effect on achievable rates, thereby motivating orientation-aware optimization in practical deployments."}

However, their extremely low received power makes them highly vulnerable to radio-frequency interference (RFI) and intentional jamming. Modern data-driven methods offer powerful representational power for such applications, however real-time and reliable jamming detection on resource-limited embedded receivers remains a key challenge due to the high computational and memory demands of the conventional learning paradigm. To address these challenges, this work presents a dictionary-based contrastive learning (DBCL) framework for GNSS jamming detection that integrates transfer learning, contrastive representation learning, and model compression techniques. The framework combines tuned contrastive and dictionary-based loss functions to enhance feature separability under low-data conditions and applies structured pruning and knowledge distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive evaluation across varying data regimes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms modern CNN, MobileViT, and ResNet-18 architectures. The framework achieves a substantial reduction in memory footprint and inference latency, confirming its suitability for real-time, low-power GNSS interference detection on embedded platforms."}

Unlike conventional pinching antenna systems (PASS), which use a single long waveguide, SWAN divides the waveguide into multiple short segments, each with a dedicated feed point. Thanks to the segmented structure, SWAN enhances sensing performance by significantly simplifying the reception model and reducing the in-waveguide propagation loss. To balance performance and complexity, three segment controlling protocols are proposed for the transceivers, namely i) \\emph{segment selection} to select a single segment for signal transceiving, ii) \\emph{segment aggregation} to aggregate signals from all segments using a single RF chain, and iii) \\emph{segment multiplexing} to jointly process the signals from all segments using individual RF chains. The theoretical sensing performance limit is first analyzed for different protocols, unveiling how the sensing performance gain of SWAN scales with the number of segments. Based on this performance limit, the Pareto fronts of sensing and communication performance are characterized for the simple one-user one-target case, which is then extended to the general multi-user single-target case based on time-division multiple access (TDMA). Numerical results are presented to verify the correctness of the derivations and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which jointly confirm the advantages of SWAN-assisted ISAC."}
