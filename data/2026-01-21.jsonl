We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference."}

This letter proposes, for the first time, a framework that realizes sparsity in multilayer US-RIS using two strategies, namely element-wise sparsity and geometric sparsity. The element-wise approach distributes a limited number of active elements irregularly across multiple layers, thereby exploiting additional spatial degrees of freedom and boosting the achievable rate. For further performance enhancement, a novel foldable RIS architecture leveraging geometric sparsity is proposed, achieving additional gains by optimizing the folding topology of its multilayer structure. Simulation results show that the proposed sparse architectures provide consistently higher achievable rates than existing designs."}

This trend is driving the evolution from static, stand-alone spectrum allocation toward spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum sharing. A critical element of this transition is spectrum sensing, which facilitates informed decision-making in shared environments. Previous studies on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio have been largely limited to individual sensors or small sensor groups. In this work, a large-scale spectrum sensing network (LarS-Net) is designed in a cost-effective manner. Spectrum sensors are either co-located with base stations (BSs) to share the tower, backhaul, and power infrastructure, or integrated directly into BSs as a new feature leveraging active BS antenna systems. As an example incumbent system, fixed service microwave link operating in the lower-7 GHz band is investigated. This band is a primary candidate for 6G, being considered by the WRC-23, ITU, and FCC. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the minimum subset of BSs equipped with sensing capability to guarantee a target incumbent detection probability. The simulations account for various sensor antenna configurations, propagation channel models, and duty cycles for both incumbent transmissions and sensing operations. Building on this framework, we introduce three network-level sensing performance metrics: Emission Detection Probability (EDP), Temporal Detection Probability (TDP), and Temporal Mis-detection Probability (TMP), which jointly capture spatial coverage, temporal detectability, and multi-node diversity effects. Using these metrics, we analyze the impact of LarS-Net inter-site distance, noise uncertainty, and sensing duty-cycle on large-scale sensing performance."}

One crucial diagnostic criterion is the identification of unusual pigment network (PN). However, distinguishing between regular (typical) and irregular (atypical) PN is challenging. This study aims to automate the PN detection process using a directional imaging algorithm and classify PN types using machine learning classifiers. The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis."}

If a propagation channel affects all transmitted signals equally, the relative phases are a function of the directions of departure and arrival, as well as the transmit and receive hardware. In a non-stationary channel, the amplitudes and phases of arriving signals may vary significantly over time, making it infeasible to directly measure the influence of hardware. In this paper, we present a calibration method for achieving indirect measurement and compensation of hardware influences in non-stationary channels. Our method characterizes the patterns of array elements relative to a reference element and estimates these relative patterns, termed residual surfaces, using a Slepian spherical harmonic basis. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our calibration method achieves beamforming gains that closely match theoretical optimums. Our results also show a reduction in the error in estimating the target direction, lower side lobes, and improve null-steering capabilities."}

Existing deep learning methods typically address these in the spatial domain with an undifferentiated optimization objective, making it difficult to disentangle overlapping artifacts and limiting correction effectiveness. In this work, we perform a Fourier-domain analysis and reveal that these degradations are spectrally separable: Poisson noise and photon scarcity cause high-frequency phase perturbations, while attenuation errors suppress low-frequency amplitude components. Leveraging this insight, we propose FourierPET, a Fourier-based unrolled reconstruction framework grounded in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. It consists of three tailored modules: a spectral consistency module that enforces global frequency alignment to maintain data fidelity, an amplitude-phase correction module that decouples and compensates for high-frequency phase distortions and low-frequency amplitude suppression, and a dual adjustment module that accelerates convergence during iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FourierPET achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, while offering enhanced interpretability through frequency-aware correction."}

While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off. These results establish feedback-driven adaptation as a principled strategy for bridging the gap between algorithmic design and deployment-ready deblurring models."}

For appropriate linear functions (e.g., XORs), such non-cooperative schemes can achieve some of the best NDT-computation tradeoff points so far obtained in the literature.

Traditional registration methods often struggle to ensure accuracy due to the large intensity differences between diffusion data and high-resolution anatomical structures. This paper proposes an unsupervised registration framework based on a generative registration network, which transforms the original multimodal registration problem between b0 and T1w images into a unimodal registration task between a generated image and the real T1w image. This effectively reduces the complexity of cross-modal registration. The framework first employs an image synthesis model to generate images with T1w-like contrast, and then learns a deformation field from the generated image to the fixed T1w image. The registration network jointly optimizes local structural similarity and cross-modal statistical dependency to improve deformation estimation accuracy. Experiments conducted on two independent datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in multimodal registration tasks."}

Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival."}

Resisting screen-shooting attacks typically requires high-strength watermark embedding, inevitably degrading the cover image. To resolve the robustness-fidelity conflict, non-intrusive watermarking has emerged as a solution by constructing logical verification keys without altering the original content. However, existing non-intrusive schemes lack the capacity to withstand screen-shooting noise. While deep learning offers a potential remedy, we observe that directly applying it leads to a previously underexplored failure mode, the Structural Shortcut: networks tend to learn trivial identity mappings and neglect the image-watermark binding. Furthermore, even when logical binding is enforced, standard training strategies cannot fully bridge the noise gap, yielding suboptimal robustness against physical distortions. In this paper, we propose NiMark, an end-to-end framework addressing these challenges. First, to eliminate the structural shortcut, we introduce the Sigmoid-Gated XOR (SG-XOR) estimator to enable gradient propagation for the logical operation, effectively enforcing rigid image-watermark binding. Second, to overcome the robustness bottleneck, we devise a two-stage training strategy integrating a restorer to bridge the domain gap caused by screen-shooting noise. Experiments demonstrate that NiMark consistently outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods against both digital attacks and screen-shooting noise, while maintaining zero visual distortion."}

As a result, most radar-based fall detectors are trained on staged falls from young volunteers, and representation choices are rarely tested against the radar signals from dangerous falls. This paper uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar digital twin as a single simulated room testbed to study how representation choice affects fall/non-fall discrimination. From the same simulated range-Doppler sequence, Doppler-time spectrograms, three-channel per-receiver spectrogram stacks, and time-pooled range-Doppler maps (RDMs) are derived and fed to an identical compact CNN under matched training on a balanced fall/non-fall dataset. In this twin, temporal spectrograms reach 98-99% test accuracy with similar precision and recall for both classes, while static RDMs reach 89.4% and show more variable training despite using the same backbone. A qualitative comparison between synthetic and measured fall spectrograms suggests that the twin captures gross Doppler-time structure, but amplitude histograms reveal differences in the distributions of amplitude values consistent with receiver processing not modeled in the twin. Because the twin omits noise and hardware impairments and is only qualitatively compared to a single measured example, these results provide representation-level guidance under controlled synthetic conditions rather than ready-to-use clinical performance in real settings."}

However, current approaches suffer from key limitations-namely, reliance on a single type of sensitive Gaussian kernel and the manual selection of free parameters. To address these issues and further boost robustness, this paper introduces the concept of multi-kernel mixture correntropy (MKMC), along with its key properties. MKMC employs a flexible kernel function composed of a mixture of two Students t-Cauchy functions with adjustable (non-zero) means. Building on this criterion within multi-sensor networks, we propose a robust distributed extended Kalman filter-AMKMMC-RDEKF based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy. To reduce communication overhead, a consensus averaging strategy is incorporated. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is introduced to mitigate the impact of manually tuned free parameters. At the same time, the computational complexity and convergence ability of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through challenging scenarios involving power system and land vehicle state estimation."}

The EWABG model works by integrating individual path-loss models into one single model in the least-squares sense, allowing to extend knowledge from frequencies and distances covered by path-loss datasets or path-loss propagation models. The proposed EWABG model is the first non-linear extension of the common ABG-based approach, which surpasses the non-uniformity problem between the low and high 5G frequencies (as most measurements campaigns have taken place in low frequencies). The EWABG also addresses the problem of removing outlier measurements, a step not included in previous propagation path-loss models. In this case, we have compared the most recent techniques for avoiding outliers, and we have adopted the Theil-Sen method, due to its strong robustness demonstrated in the experiments carried out. In addition, the proposed model specifically considers non-linear attenuation by atmospheric gases, in order to improve its estimations. The good performance of the proposed EWABG model has been tested and compared against recent 5G propagation path-loss models including the ABG and WABG models. The exhaustive experimentation carried out includes the 5G non-line-of-sight environment in different 5G scenarios, UMiSC, UMiOS and UMa. The proposed EWABG obtains the best accuracy, specially in noisy environments with outliers, reporting negligible increment error rates (with respect to the non-outliers situation), lower than 1%, compared to the ABG and WABG."}

Methods to compensate for turbulence typically rely on realistic turbulence data, which can be generated by i) experiment, ii) high-fidelity CFD, iii) low-fidelity CFD, and iv) autoregressive methods. However, each of these methods has significant drawbacks, including monetary and/or computational expense, limited quantity, inaccurate statistics, and overall complexity. In contrast, the boiling flow algorithm is a simple, computationally efficient model that can generate atmospheric phase screen data with only a handful of parameters. However, boiling flow has not been widely used in aero-optic applications, at least in part because some of these parameters, such as r0, are not clearly defined for aero-optic data. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to use the boiling flow algorithm to generate arbitrary length synthetic data to match the statistics of measured aero-optic data. Importantly, we modify the standard boiling flow method to generate anisotropic phase screens. While this model does not fully capture all statistics, it can be used to generate data that matches the temporal power spectrum or the anisotropic 2D structure function, with the ability to trade fidelity to one for fidelity to the other."}

In this paper, we assign distance-based weights to RSS measurements, providing higher reliability to closer anchor nodes. Using the weighted RSS measurements and generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), we propose the GTRS-based localization technique with Unknown Transmit Power (GUTP), which can be solved by a simple bisection method. Unlike conventional localization methods that require prior knowledge of the target node's transmit power, GUTP jointly estimates both the location and transmit power of the target node, broadening its practical use. Additionally, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for RSS-based underwater localization with known and unknown transmit power, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GUTP achieves enhanced accuracy and significantly lower computational complexity in estimating the target node's location and transmit power compared to existing semidefinite programming (SDP)-based techniques."}

However, conventional downtilted base stations primarily provide sectorized forward lobes for ground services, failing to sense air targets due to backward blind zones. In this paper, a novel antenna structure is proposed to enable air-ground beam steering, facilitating simultaneous full-space sensing and communication (S&C). Specifically, instead of inserting a reflector behind the antenna array for backlobe mitigation, an omni-steering plate is introduced to collaborate with the active array for omnidirectional beamforming. Building on this hardware innovation, sum S&C mutual information (MI) is maximized, jointly optimizing user scheduling, passive coefficients of the omni-steering plate, and beamforming of the active array. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: one for optimizing passive coefficients via Riemannian gradient on the manifold, and the other for optimizing user scheduling and active array beamforming. Exploiting relationships among S&C MI, data decoding MMSE, and parameter estimation MMSE, the original subproblem is equivalently transformed into a sum weighted MMSE problem, rigorously established via the Lagrangian and first-order optimality conditions. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in sum-MI and MSE, while providing 360 sensing coverage. Beampattern analysis further demonstrates effective user scheduling and accurate target alignment."}

In this paper, we formulate the problem as the minimization of the transmit power subject to a common broadcast rate constraint across all PRs and a bit error rate (BER) constraint at the BRx. The problem is nonconvex due to the unit-modulus RIS constraint and coupled quadratic forms. Leveraging a rate-balanced reformulation and a monotonic BER ratio characterization, we develop a low-complexity penalty-based block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates. Numerical results show fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and reduced power consumption of the considered RIS-enhanced information-decoupled SR system over conventional SR baselines."}

In this study, we present the first application of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) as a non-invasive diagnosis tool in plant pathology. Compared with conventional molecular, spectroscopic, and immunoassay-based methods, THz-TDS offers distinct advantages, including non-contact, non-destructive, and preparation-free measurement, enabling rapid in situ screening of plant and soil samples. Our results demonstrate that THz-TDS can differentiate between healthy and clubroot-infected tissues by detecting both structural and biochemical alterations. Specifically, infected roots exhibit a blue shift in the refractive index in the low-frequency THz range, along with distinct peaks-indicative of disruptions in water transport and altered metabolic activity in both roots and leaves. Interestingly, the characteristic root swelling observed in infected plants reflects internal tissue disorganization rather than an actual increase in water content. Furthermore, a physics-constrained neural network is proposed to extract the main feature in THz-TDS. A comprehensive evaluation, including time-domain signals, amplitude and phase images, refractive index and absorption coefficient maps, and principal component analysis, provides enhanced contrast and spatial resolution compared to raw time-domain or frequency signals. These findings suggest that THz-TDS holds significant potential for early, non-destructive detection of plant diseases and may serve as a valuable tool to limit their spread in agricultural systems."}

Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable.

Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual). Qualitative examples further show the uncertainty maps based on quantile regression capture the magnitude and spatial distribution of reconstruction errors across acceleration factors, with regions of elevated uncertainty aligning with pathologies and artifacts. The proposed framework enables evaluation of reconstruction quality without access to fully-sampled ground-truth reference images.

Although additive noise can be correlated in practical scenarios, e.g., due to jamming, clutter, or other external disturbances, the effect of such correlation on the MMSE channel estimator in this setting remains unexplored in prior work. Against this backdrop, we derive a novel analytical expression for the general MIMO MMSE channel estimator, which is inherently nonlinear in one-bit observations, and accommodates arbitrary channel and noise correlation structures. To further characterize the impact of noise correlation, we subsequently specialize the general MMSE expression to certain tractable multi antenna configurations in which both the channel and the noise assume single-parameter constant correlation structures. Our analyses reveal nontrivial, noise-correlation-induced scenarios in which the estimator remains linear despite non-zero channel and noise correlation parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that, at low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio, noise correlation improves the MMSE performance when channels are uncorrelated, but degrades performance when channels are strongly correlated."}

Characterization of integrated mmWave transmitters remains challenging due to limited angular coverage and alignment variability in conventional probe-station techniques, as well as the impracticality of anechoic-chamber testing for platform-mounted active modules. To address these challenges, we introduce RAPTAR, an autonomous measurement system for angular received-power acquisition under realistic installation constraints. A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules.

VAST derives vessel masks directly from complex 4D Flow data by iteratively fusing magnitude- and phase-based background statistics. It then reconstructs velocities via continuity-constrained phase unwrapping, outlier correction, and low-rank denoising to reduce noise and aliasing while promoting mass-consistent flow fields, with processing completing in minutes per case on a standard CPU. We validate VAST on synthetic data from an internal carotid artery aneurysm model across SNR = 2-20 and severe phase wrapping (up to five-fold), on in vitro Poiseuille flow, and on an in vivo internal carotid aneurysm dataset. In synthetic benchmarks, VAST maintains near quarter-voxel surface accuracy and reduces velocity root-mean-square error by up to fourfold under the most degraded conditions. In vitro, it segments the channel within approximately half a voxel of expert annotations and reduces velocity error by 39% (unwrapped) and 77% (aliased). In vivo, VAST closely matches expert time-of-flight masks and lowers divergence residuals by about 30%, indicating a more self-consistent intracranial flow field.

Since each subtask has a distinct goal, the existing task-oriented communication schemes are not designed to handle different goals for different subtasks. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a hierarchical task-oriented communication (HiTOC) framework. We consider a system with an edge server and a robot as an edge device. The high-level planner and low-level actor modules reside on the edge server. The robot transmits only the environment information that is relevant to the current subtask in order to complete a long-horizon task. We propose a conditional variational information bottleneck (cVIB) approach to train the HiTOC framework to adaptively transmit minimal information required for each subtask. Simulations conducted on the AI2-THOR platform demonstrate that the proposed HiTOC framework outperforms three state-of-the-art schemes in terms of the success rate on MAP-THOR benchmark."}

Existing numerical methods suffer from prohibitive latency, while standard deep learning often ignores dynamic interference topology, limiting scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchically decoupled framework synergizing graph neural networks (GNNs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, on the short timescale, we develop a topology-aware GNN beamformer by incorporating GraphNorm. By modeling the dynamic UAV-user association as a time-varying heterogeneous graph, this method explicitly extracts interference patterns to achieve sub-millisecond inference. On the long timescale, trajectory planning is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solved via the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, facilitating cooperative behaviors. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization heuristics and deep learning baselines in terms of system sum rate, convergence speed, and generalization capability."}

Continual learning (CL) offers a natural solution but current approaches either impose a maximum modality configuration or suffer from severe forgetting in buffer-free settings. We introduce CLMU-Net, a replay-based CL framework for 3D brain lesion segmentation that supports arbitrary and variable modality combinations without requiring prior knowledge of the maximum set. A conceptually simple yet effective channel-inflation strategy maps any modality subset into a unified multi-channel representation, enabling a single model to operate across diverse datasets. To enrich inherently local 3D patch features, we incorporate lightweight domain-conditioned textual embeddings that provide global modality-disease context for each training case. Forgetting is further reduced through principled replay using a compact buffer composed of both prototypical and challenging samples. Experiments on five heterogeneous MRI brain datasets demonstrate that CLMU-Net consistently outperforms popular CL baselines. Notably, our method yields an average Dice score improvement of $\\geq$ 18\\% while remaining robust under heterogeneous-modality conditions. These findings underscore the value of flexible modality handling, targeted replay, and global contextual cues for continual medical image segmentation.

EDTL pretrains DNN models on data-rich production lines (source domain) and adapts them to data-limited lines (target domain), reducing dependency on large datasets.

It involves ill-posed inverse problems, such as inpainting and super-resolution. Although deep learning methods have transformed the field through data-driven learning, their effectiveness hinges on access to meticulously curated ground-truth datasets. This fundamentally restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable. This paper presents SHARE (Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Equivariance), a fully unsupervised framework that unifies geometric equivariance principles with low-rank spectral modelling to eliminate the need for ground truth. SHARE's core concept is to exploit the intrinsic invariance of hyperspectral structures under differentiable geometric transformations (e.g. rotations and scaling) to derive self-supervision signals through equivariance consistency constraints. Our novel Dynamic Adaptive Spectral Attention (DASA) module further enhances this paradigm shift by explicitly encoding the global low-rank property of HSI and adaptively refining local spectral-spatial correlations through learnable attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on HSI inpainting and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHARE. Our method outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to that of supervised methods. We hope that our approach will shed new light on HSI restoration and broader scientific imaging scenarios. The code will be released at https://github.com/xuwayyy/SHARE."}

The renewable energy state of base station batteries and the number of occupied channels are modeled as a quasi-birth-death process. We construct models for the probability of channel blocking, average successful transmission probability for users, downlink throughput, carbon emissions, and carbon efficiency based on stochastic geometry. Based on these analyses, an energy-based cell association scheme is proposed to optimize the carbon efficiency of cellular networks. The results show that, compared to the closest cell association scheme, the energy-based cell association scheme is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the network by 13.0% and improving the carbon efficiency by 11.3%."}

In this paper, we propose LRC-DHVC, a hierarchical video compression network, which allows continuous local rate control on a pixel level to vary the spatial quality distribution within individual video frames. This is achieved by concatenating a quality map to the input frame and applying a weighted MSE loss which matches the pixelwise trade-off factors in the quality map. During training, the model sees a variety of quality maps due to a constrained-random generation. Our model is the first neural video compression network, which can continuously and spatially adapt to varying quality constraints. Due to the wide quality and bit rate range, a single set of network parameters is sufficient. Compared to single rate point networks, which scale linearly with the number of rate points, the memory requirements for our network parameters remain constant. The code and model are available at link-updated-upon-acceptance."}

Based on this model, we jointly optimize the time-allocation ratio, sensing covariance matrix, and robust downlink beamforming under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The resulting non-convex problem is addressed via a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based reformulation within an alternating-optimization framework. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose two low-complexity suboptimal designs: an error-ignorant scheme and a maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves localization accuracy over far-field and monostatic setups, thereby reducing channel estimation errors and ultimately enhancing the achievable rate. Moreover, the error-ignorant scheme performs well under stringent sensing requirements, whereas the MRT-based scheme remains robust over a wide range of sensing requirements by adapting the time-allocation ratio, albeit with some beamforming loss."}

Specifically, an end-to-end semantic distortion function is approximated by deriving an upper bound composing of source and channel coding induced components, and then a hybrid Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) is also derived for target position under imperfect time synchronization. To facilitate the joint optimization, a distortion minimization problem is formulated by considering the HCRB threshold, channel uses, and power budget.

Pixel antennas represent a general class of reconfigurable antenna designs in which the radiating surface, regardless of its shape or size, is divided into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. Each pixel is connected to its neighboring elements through radio frequency switches. By controlling pixel connections, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured. However, conventional pixel antennas have only a single, fixed-position feeding port, which is not efficient for angular sensing. Therefore, in this work, we further extend the reconfigurability of pixel antennas by introducing the HRPA, which enables both geometry control of the pixel antenna and switching of its feeding ports. The model of the proposed HRPA, including both circuit and radiation parameters, is derived. A codebook is then defined, consisting of pixel connection states and feeding port positions for each sensing area. Based on this codebook, an efficient optimization approach is developed to minimize the Cram\\acute{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{e}}}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and obtain the optimal HRPA geometries for angular sensing within a given area. Numerical results show that the HRPA reduces the angle estimation error by more than 50% across the full three-dimensional sphere when compared with a conventional uniform planar array of the same size. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights the potential of HRPA for integrated sensing and communication systems."}

Despite its compact size (<20k parameters), the proposed DC-CNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7% over the full range, with <1 dB error for SIR >= -30 dB. This robustness and efficiency make DC-CNN suitable for deployment on embedded UAV platforms for interference-resilient antenna pattern characterization."}

Nevertheless, underwater communication is constrained by narrow bandwidth, high latency, and strict energy constraints, which are the source of efficiency problems in traditional data-centric networks. To tackle these problematic issues, this work provides a survey of recent advances in Semantic Communication (SC) for IoUT, a novel communication paradigm that seeks to harness not raw symbol information but rather its meaning and/or contextual significance. In this paper, we investigate the emerging advanced AI-powered frameworks, including large language models (LLMs), diffusion-based generative encoders, and federated learning (FL), that bridge semantic compression with context-aware prioritization and robust information reconstruction over noisy underwater channels. Hybrid acoustic-optical-RF architectures and edge-intelligent semantic encoders are also considered enablers of sustainable, adaptive operations. Examples in underwater archaeology, marine ecology, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordination are provided as a relief to illustrate the merits of meaning-driven connectivity. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including semantic representations standardization, cross-domain interpolation, and privacy-support schemes. These issues must be addressed in the future before trustworthy SC-enabled IoUT systems can be developed for underwater communication."}

RASHND leverages inter-node communication and an intelligent algorithm selection process, incorporating combining techniques like distributed-Maximal Ratio Combining (d-MRC), distributed-Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error Estimation(d-LMMSE), and Selection Combining (SC). These algorithms are selected to improve performance by adapting to changing network conditions.

To address this intractability, this work derives novel closed-form deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions for both centralized and distributed uplink operations. Valid for Rician fading channels with minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive combining and MMSE channel estimation, these expressions depend exclusively on long-term channel statistics, providing a tractable alternative to computationally expensive instantaneous CSI-driven optimization. Building on these results, we develop statistical-CSI-based algorithms for joint subarray selection, users scheduling, and pilot assignment, leveraging the derived SINR approximations to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) among scheduled users while preserving computational tractability. The proposed framework exploits the spatial sparsity of user equipment (UE) visibility regions (VRs) to enable more aggressive pilot reuse than is possible in conventional massive MIMO.

Unlike existing works that mostly assume perfect channel state information (CSI) or location information of Eves, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario, where the locations of Bobs are perfectly known, while only imperfect location information of Eves is available at the BS. We first formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of Bobs while guaranteeing a worst-case limit on the eavesdropping rate under location uncertainty. By transforming Cartesian position errors into the polar domain, we reveal an important near-field angular-error amplification effect: for the same location error, the closer the Eve, the larger the angle error, severely degrading the performance of conventional robust beamforming methods based on imperfect channel state information. To address this issue, we first establish the conditions for which the first-order Taylor approximation of the near-field channel steering vector under location uncertainty is largely accurate. Then, we propose a two-stage robust beamforming method, which first partitions the uncertainty region into multiple fan-shaped sub-regions, followed by the second stage to formulate and solve a refined linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based robust beamforming optimization problem. In addition, the proposed method is further extended to scenarios with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves. Finally, numerical results validate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between rate performance and secrecy robustness, hence significantly outperforming existing benchmarks under Eve location uncertainty."}

In this study, low-complexity DL-based SD methods are proposed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS system and examined under Nakagami-$m$ channel conditions. The symbols obtained from the receiver antennas are combined using maximum ratio combining (MRC) and detected with the help of a DL-based detector implemented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual network (ResNet). Complexity analysis reveals that the MLP architecture offers significantly lower computational complexity compared to CNN, ResNet, and classical methods such as maximum likelihood detection (MLD).

In dense IoT scenarios, synchronization may be disrupted either by the movement of nodes away from base stations or by the unavailability of reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which can be affected by physical obstructions, multipath fading, or environmental interference, such as such as walls, buildings, moving objects, or electromagnetic noise from surrounding devices. In such contexts, distributed synchronization through Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution, as it enables simultaneous transmission to multiple users with different power levels, supporting efficient synchronization while minimizing the signaling overhead. Moreover, NOMA also plays a vital role for dynamic priority management in dense and heterogeneous IoT environments. In this article, we proposed a Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework \"TSN-IoT\" that integrates the mechanisms of conventional Precision Time Protocol (PTP) based synchronization, distributed synchronization and data transmission. The framework is designed as a four-tier architecture that facilitates prioritized data delivery from sensor nodes to the central base station. We demonstrated the performance of \"TSN-IoT\" through a healthcare use case, where intermittent connectivity and varying data priority levels present key challenges for reliable communication. Synchronization speed and end-to-end delay were evaluated through a series of simulations implemented in Python. Results show that, compared to priority-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), TSN-IoT achieves significantly better performance by offering improved synchronization opportunities and enabling parallel transmissions over the same sub-carrier."}

We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method."}

This improves the phase estimate at the most recent sample. Despite its widespread empirical use, the systematic endpoint distortions of ecHT have lacked a principled, closed-form analysis. In this study, we derive the ecHT endpoint operator analytically and demonstrate that its output can be decomposed into a desired positive-frequency term (a deterministic complex gain that induces a calibratable amplitude/phase bias) and a residual leakage term setting an irreducible variance floor. This yields (i) an explicit characterisation and bounds for endpoint phase/amplitude error, (ii) a mean-squared-error-optimal scalar calibration (c-ecHT), and (iii) practical design rules relating window length, bandwidth/order, and centre-frequency mismatch to residual bias via an endpoint group delay.

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE TSP", "summary": "Diversity is an essential concept associated with communication reliability in multipath channels since it determines the slope of bit error rate performance in the medium to high signal-to-noise ratio regions. However, most of the existing analytical frameworks were developed for specific modulation schemes while the efficient validation of full multipath diversity for general modulation schemes remains an open problem. To fill this research gap, we propose to utilize random constellation rotation to ease the conditions for full-diversity modulation designs. For linearly precoded cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we prove that maximum multipath diversity can be attained as long as the spread matrix does not have zero entries, which is a sufficient but easily satisfied condition. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for general modulation schemes, whose verification can be divided into validation tasks for each column of the modulation matrix. Based on the proposed conditions, maximum diversity order can be attained with the probability of 1 by enabling a randomly generated rotation pattern for both time and doubly dispersive channels. The theoretical analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the diversity evaluation can be concentrated on the pairwise error probability when the number of error symbols is one, which reduces the complexity of diversity-driven design and performance analysis for novel modulation schemes significantly in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results for various modulation schemes confirm that the theoretical analysis holds in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, when employing practical detectors, the random constellation rotation technique consistently enhance the transmission reliability for both coded and uncoded systems."}

We analyze these effects in real measurements in the frequency range 2-18 GHz, taken with the Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility at TU Ilmenau.

To address this challenge, we propose a burst aware forecasting solution. This challenge may arise in a wide range of wireless networks; therefore, the proposed solution is broadly applicable to settings characterized by bursty traffic patterns where accurate demand forecasting is essential. Our approach introduces three key enhancements to a transformer architecture: (i) a distance from the last burst embedding to capture burst proximity, (ii) two additional linear layers in the decoder to forecast both upcoming bursts and their relative impact, and (iii) use of an asymmetric cost function during model training to better capture burst dynamics. Empirical evaluations in an Earth-fixed cell under high-traffic demand scenario demonstrate that the proposed model reduces prediction error by up to 94% at a one-step horizon and maintains the ability to accurately capture bursts even near the end of longer prediction horizons following Mean Square Error (MSE) metric."}
