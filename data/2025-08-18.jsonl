Under this framework, the\nproblem of joint beamforming design and transmission scheduling is formulated\nto improve the system throughput and reduce the age-of-information of GFUs. The\naforementioned problem is transferred into a Markov Decision Process to model\nthe changing environment with the transmission/ waiting/ retransmission of\nGFUs. In an effort to solve the pertinent problem, firstly, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) based transmission scheduling approach is proposed\nfor determining the optimal transmission probability based on the available\ntransmission slots and transmission status of GFUs. Secondly, a hierarchical\nlearning algorithm is proposed to analyze the channel state information of GBUs\nand the transmission status of GFUs, and to train an upper-level policy based\non this analysis for beamforming to achieve efficient grant-based transmission,\nwhile a lower-level policy adapts to maximize the utilization of transmission\nslots allocated by the upper-level agent. The two policies interact to improve\nchannel access and avoid collisions. Numerical results reveal that 1) The DRL\nbased transmission scheduling outperforms existing adaptive and state-dependent\nbaselines in AoI reduction, where an average\nthree-time-slots-earlier-transmission can be obtained compared to the\nstate-dependent choice, and five time slots earlier can be achieved when\ncomparing to the adaptive choice; 2) The hierarchical learning algorithm is\nable to achieve approximately a 31.82% gain while maintaining the average AoI\nof GFUs within 1.5 time slots. 3) The effectiveness of the hierarchical\nlearning scheme in NOMA-assisted SGF system is validated across scenarios with\nGFUs counts from 1-5 times of GBUs."}

However, training\naccurate automatic models requires large amounts of labelled data. Despite the\navailability of publicly available subcortical segmentation datasets for\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a significant gap exists for Computed\nTomography (CT). This paper proposes an automatic ensemble framework to\ngenerate high-quality subcortical segmentation labels for CT scans by\nleveraging existing MRI-based models. We introduce a robust ensembling pipeline\nto integrate them and apply it to unannotated paired MRI-CT data, resulting in\na comprehensive CT subcortical segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed\nframework. Furthermore, using our generated CT dataset, we train segmentation\nmodels that achieve improved performance on related segmentation tasks. To\nfacilitate future research, we make our source code, generated dataset, and\ntrained models publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/SCSE-Biomedical-Computing-Group/CT-Subcortical-Segmentation,\nmarking the first open-source release for CT subcortical segmentation to the\nbest of our knowledge."}

To alleviate\nthis annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep\nlearning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge\ndistillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves\ntraining an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online\nknowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members.\nThis process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble,\nthereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself.\nPost-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test\ntime, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the\nensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model\nperforms better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates\nsuperior performance on both the \\emph{International Skin Imaging\nCollaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current\nstate-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge\ndistillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while\nproviding a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in\nreal-world scenarios."}
