Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to\nspecific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus\nlimiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM\nframeworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models\n(VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They\nmainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic\ninformation, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with\nunderstanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric\nEntropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It\nestablishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the\ncodec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and\ndiscard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional\nentropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of\nvideo decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps\nthe codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while\nsqueezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion\n(SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through\nsemantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves\nmachine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with\nsignificant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%),\nvideo object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple\nobject tracking (44.94%). We will release our code."}
