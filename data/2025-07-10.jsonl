Since human gesture motion\ninduces subtle and random variations in wireless multipath propagation, how to\naccurately model human gesture channels has become a crucial issue for the\ndesign and validation of ISAC systems. To this end, this paper proposes a deep\nlearning-based human gesture channel modeling framework for ISAC scenarios, in\nwhich the human body is decomposed into multiple body parts, and the mapping\nbetween human gestures and their corresponding multipath characteristics is\nlearned from real-world measurements. Specifically, a Poisson neural network is\nemployed to predict the number of Multi-Path Components (MPCs) for each human\nbody part, while Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) are reused to\ngenerate the scattering points, which are further used to reconstruct\ncontinuous channel impulse responses and micro-Doppler signatures. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and\ngeneralization across different gestures and subjects, providing an\ninterpretable approach for data augmentation and the evaluation of\ngesture-based ISAC systems."}

To address\nthis issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,\nnamed TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation\nthat first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling\npositions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then\nrepresented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular\nfeature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and\nresidual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway\nstructures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two\ndatasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed\nTfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions\ncompared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest\noverall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,\nAirway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung\nfibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/QibiaoWu/TfeNet."}

However, it faces challenges such as limited\nbandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with\nultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded\ninto a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a\nsubset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling\nfine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the\nreceiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame\njoint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and\ninter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network\nconditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO)\nreinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource\nallocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of\nExperience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency,\nbandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed\nMUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks."}

Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to\nsubstantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot\nbe directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,\nUS speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body\nmicrostructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that\nobtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by\npioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also\ncannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm\nfor speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is\nthat applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces\ntissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,\nwhile preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective\nspeckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and\nisolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,\nSpeckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based\ndenoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic\nsimulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from\nmultiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and\nadaptability to images from unseen domains. \\textit{Code and datasets will be\nreleased upon acceptance."}

Existing datasets only contain non-critical RFOs,\nlike necklace or zipper, further limiting their utility for developing\nclinically impactful detection algorithms. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce \"Hopkins RFOs Bench\", the first and largest dataset of its kind,\ncontaining 144 chest X-ray images of critical RFO cases collected over 18 years\nfrom the Johns Hopkins Health System. Using this dataset, we benchmark several\nstate-of-the-art object detection models, highlighting the need for enhanced\ndetection methodologies for critical RFO cases. Recognizing data scarcity\nchallenges, we further explore image synthetic methods to bridge this gap. We\nevaluate two advanced synthetic image methods, DeepDRR-RFO, a physics-based\nmethod, and RoentGen-RFO, a diffusion-based method, for creating realistic\nradiographs featuring critical RFOs.
