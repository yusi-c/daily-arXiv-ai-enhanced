Accepted to IEEE Signal Processing and Wireless\n  Communications (SPAWC) 2025 conference", "summary": "Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make\nit possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional\napproaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a\nsimple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters\neach time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude\napproximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained\nvia complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on\nAI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit\nchannel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we\ndesign a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN)\nto estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a\ntraining method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order\ngradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling\noptimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the\nproposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our\nresults demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable\nchannel parameter tuning with limited latency."}
