In contrast, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are inexpensive, widely accessible, and offer a promising modality for conditioning the generative synthesis of cine CMR. To this end, we propose ECGFlowCMR, a novel ECG-to-CMR generative framework that integrates a Phase-Aware Masked Autoencoder (PA-MAE) and an Anatomy-Motion Disentangled Flow (AMDF) to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the cross-modal temporal mismatch between multi-beat ECG recordings and single-cycle CMR sequences, and (2) the anatomical observability gap due to the limited structural information inherent in ECGs. Extensive experiments on the UK Biobank and a proprietary clinical dataset demonstrate that ECGFlowCMR can generate realistic cine CMR sequences from ECG inputs, enabling scalable pretraining and improving performance on downstream cardiac disease classification and phenotype prediction tasks."}

Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging. It enables imaging speeds 32 times faster than current methods."}

However, the gap between the best compressed models and the full precision model still remains large and a need for deeper understanding of compression theory on more performant models remains. Prior research on quantization of LLMs has shown that Hadamard transformations lead to weights and activations with reduced outliers, which leads to improved performance. We argue that while the Hadamard transform does reduce the effect of outliers, an empirical analysis on how the transform functions remains needed. By studying the distributions of weights and activations of SwinIR-light, we show with statistical analysis that lower errors is caused by the Hadamard transforms ability to reduce the ranges, and increase the proportion of values around $0$. Based on these findings, we introduce CompSRT, a more performant way to compress the image super resolution transformer network SwinIR-light. We perform Hadamard-based quantization, and we also perform scalar decomposition to introduce two additional trainable parameters. Our quantization performance statistically significantly surpasses the SOTA in metrics with gains as large as 1.53 dB, and visibly improves visual quality by reducing blurriness at all bitwidths. At $3$-$4$ bits, to show our method is compatible with pruning for increased compression, we also prune $40\\%$ of weights and show that we can achieve $6.67$-$15\\%$ reduction in bits per parameter with comparable performance to SOTA."}

We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \\emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption.

Furthermore, we derive a closed-form metric that effectively maximizes the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI) at a given signal-to-noise ratio. We focus on the fact that the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmann manifold provides a mathematically sparse property, and establish design criteria for sparse noncoherent codes based on our analyses. In numerical results, the proposed sparse noncoherent codes outperform conventional methods in terms of both symbol error rate and AMI, and asymptotically approach the performance of the optimal Grassmannian constellations in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime.

The transmitter encodes the outputs of the first part of a neural network before sending them to the receiver for completing the inference. Practical FCM methods ``sandwich'' a traditional codec between pre- and post-processing neural networks, called wrappers, to make features easier to compress using video codecs. Since traditional codecs are non-differentiable, the wrappers are trained using a proxy codec, which is later replaced by a standard codec after training. These codecs perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) based on the sum of squared errors (SSE). Because the RDO does not consider the post-processing wrapper, the inner codec can invest bits in preserving information that the post-processing later discards. In this paper, we modify the bit-allocation in the inner codec via a wrapper-aware weighted SSE metric. To make wrapper-aware RDO (WA-RDO) practical for FCM, we propose: 1) temporal reuse of weights across a group of pictures and 2) fixed, architecture- and task-dependent weights trained offline. Under MPEG test conditions, our methods implemented on HEVC match the VVC-based FCM state-of-the-art, effectively bridging a codec generation gap with minimal runtime overhead relative to SSE-RDO HEVC."}

A pointing error refers to beamforming gain and direction mismatch between the transmitter and receiver. We characterize it based on the inaccuracy of location estimate. We then analyze the impact of this pointing error on the received signal power and derive a tractable expression for the coverage probability, incorporating the multi-cluster fluctuating two-ray distribution to accurately model small-scale fading in THz communications. Aided by simulation results, we corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that the pointing error has a pronounced impact on the coverage probability.

This work has been submitted to IEEE", "summary": "Time-domain ADCs are attractive for high-speed wireline receivers, as time resolution scales favorably with advanced CMOS technologies, enabling multi-GS/s single-channel sampling rates. However, conventional time-domain ADCs require explicit reset of voltage-to-time and time-domain signal paths between samples, introducing dead time that fundamentally limits resolution, speed, and energy efficiency. This paper introduces a dual-edge reset-free quantization concept for asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADCs, in which both rising and falling signal edges are exploited to enable reset-free quantization within a single conversion period. By eliminating explicit reset phases, the proposed approach expands the effective conversion window and relaxes the resolution-speed tradeoff at high sampling rates. An 8-bit dual-edge asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADC is implemented in 22-nm FD-SOI, incorporating a linearity-compensated dual-edge voltage-to-time converter and a dual-edge time-to-digital converter with independently tunable rising- and falling-edge delays. The prototype occupies a core area of 0.0089 mm^2 and achieves continuous single-channel operation at 3.5 GS/s, with architectural scalability demonstrated through intermittent operation at 10.5 GS/s and higher. At 3.5 GS/s, the ADC achieves 21.6 dB SNDR and 32.2 dB SFDR. The measured performance is primarily limited by identifiable implementation-level factors rather than by architectural constraints, demonstrating the feasibility of dual-edge reset-free quantization for high-speed time-domain ADCs."}

Under such asynchronous conditions, interharmonics lose orthogonality with the fundamental and harmonic components, giving rise to additional power components. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a linearization algorithm based on DFT spectrum analysis for precise power measurement in systems containing interharmonics. The proposed approach constructs a system of linear equations from the DFT spectrum and solves it through efficient matrix operations, enabling accurate extraction of interharmonic components near the fundamental and harmonic frequencies (with a frequency interval $\\geq$1 Hz). This allows for precise measurement of power across the fundamental, harmonic, interharmonic, and cross-power bands, as well as total power. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately computes various power components under diverse conditions--including varying interharmonic/fundamental/harmonic intervals, fundamental frequency deviations, and noise. Compared to existing methods such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), Windowed interpolation FFT, and Matrix pencil-Singular value decomposition, the proposed technique reduces estimation error by several times to multiple folds and exhibits improved robustness, while maintaining a computational time of only 7 ms for processing 10-power-line-cycle (200 ms) data."}

While sparse subarray architectures can reduce cost, they introduce severe estimation ambiguity from grating lobes. To address both issues, we propose SHARE (Sparse Hierarchical Angle-Range Estimation), a novel two-stage sparse recovery algorithm. SHARE operates in two stages. It first performs coarse, unambiguous angle estimation using individual subarrays to resolve the grating lobe ambiguity. It then leverages the full sparse aperture to perform a localized joint angle-range search. This hierarchical approach avoids an exhaustive and computationally intensive two-dimensional grid search while preserving the high resolution of the large aperture. Simulation results show that SHARE significantly outperforms conventional one-shot sparse recovery methods, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in both localization accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we show that SHARE's overall localization accuracy is comparable to or even surpasses that of the fully-digital 2D-MUSIC algorithm, despite MUSIC having access to the complete, uncompressed data from every antenna element. SHARE therefore provides a practical path for high-resolution near-field ISAC systems."}

To address this issue, channel extrapolation techniques have been proposed to acquire complete CSI from a limited number of known CSIs. To improve extrapolation accuracy, environmental information, such as visual images or radar data, has been utilized, which poses challenges including additional hardware, privacy and multi-modal alignment concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a novel channel extrapolation framework by leveraging environment-related multi-path characteristics induced directly from CSI without integrating additional modalities. Specifically, we propose utilizing the multi-path characteristics in the form of power-delay profile (PDP), which is acquired using a CSI-to-PDP module. CSI-to-PDP module is trained in an AE-based framework by reconstructing the PDPs and constraining the latent low-dimensional features to represent the CSI. We further extract the total power & power-weighted delay of all the identified paths in PDP as the multi-path information. Building on this, we proposed a MAE architecture trained in a self-supervised manner to perform channel extrapolation. Unlike standard MAE approaches, our method employs separate encoders to extract features from the masked CSI and the multi-path information, which are then fused by a cross-attention module. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this framework improves extrapolation performance dramatically, with a minor increase in inference time (around 0.1 ms). Furthermore, our model shows strong generalization capabilities, particularly when only a small portion of the CSI is known, outperforming existing benchmarks."}

Practical FCM methods ``sandwich'' a traditional codec between pre- and post-processing neural networks, called wrappers, to make features easier to compress using video codecs. Since traditional codecs are non-differentiable, the wrappers are trained using a proxy codec, which is later replaced by a standard codec after training. These codecs perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) based on the sum of squared errors (SSE). Because the RDO does not consider the post-processing wrapper, the inner codec can invest bits in preserving information that the post-processing later discards. In this paper, we modify the bit-allocation in the inner codec via a wrapper-aware weighted SSE metric. To make wrapper-aware RDO (WA-RDO) practical for FCM, we propose: 1) temporal reuse of weights across a group of pictures and 2) fixed, architecture- and task-dependent weights trained offline. Under MPEG test conditions, our methods implemented on HEVC match the VVC-based FCM state-of-the-art, effectively bridging a codec generation gap with minimal runtime overhead relative to SSE-RDO HEVC."}
