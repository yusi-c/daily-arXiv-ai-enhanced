In channel modeling, we account for both the\nnear-field spherical wavefront and the wideband beam-splitting phenomena,\nresulting in a wideband near-field channel. We propose a frequency-independent\northogonal dictionary that generalizes the standard discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) matrix by introducing an additional parameter to capture the near-field\nproperty. This dictionary enables the wideband near-field channel to be\nefficiently represented with a two-dimensional (2D) block-sparse structure.\nLeveraging this specific sparse structure, the wideband near-field channel\nestimation problem can be effectively addressed within a customized compressive\nsensing framework. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of\nour proposed 2D block-sparsity-aware method over conventional\npolar-domain-based approaches for near-field wideband channel estimation."}
