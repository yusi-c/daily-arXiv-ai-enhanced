The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate\nacross 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the\nsensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at\nsites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the\nresults against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was\ntrained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3,\nzero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for\nriver samples.

To characterize the individual\nfidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated\nindividual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques,\nfollowed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from\nanalog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world\ndeployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an\nanomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our\nsystem through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes\nup to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a\nnormalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51\nseconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state\nof the art. Additional simulation results demonstrate scalability to larger\ncrowd sizes. Overall, our results show that our pipeline enables fast, robust,\nand highly accurate counting of seated crowds."}

The scheme operates in two\ntime slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication\nusers (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground\nlocations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from\ntargets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs\nbeamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode\ninformation from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern\nefficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective\noptimization problem to maximize both the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal\npower from the targets.

How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best\nperformance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires\nat most $K + \\sqrt{\\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the\nability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling\ninterference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes\n$\\sqrt{K^2 + \\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound\non the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task\nindividually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the\nperformance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the\nbeamformers.

The mean sensitivity before channel selection was\n76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection,\ndominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of\nchannels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1%\nwith an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the\nseizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous\nseizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG\nrecordings."}

In\nthis paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA\narray-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a\nbase station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our\ngoal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while\nadhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving\nregion. The formulated problem is inherently highly non-convex, rendering it\nchallenging to acquire a globally optimal solution. As a compromise, we propose\na low-complexity two-stage optimization algorithm to obtain an effective\nsuboptimal solution. Specifically, in stage one, the SIC decoding order is\nfirst determined by solving a channel gain maximization problem. Then, in stage\ntwo, with the given SIC decoding order, the beamforming vectors, MA positions,\nand users' decoding indicator matrix are iteratively optimized by capitalizing\non alternating optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA), and genetic\nalgorithm (GA). Simulation results unveil that the sum-rate performance of the\nproposed MA-enabled downlink NOMA system significantly outperforms that of\nconventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Moreover, the results also\nshow that the antenna position optimization in the proposed algorithm can\nfurther enhance the advantages of NOMA over space division multiple access\n(SDMA)."}

One of the great strengths\nof wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\nis the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources\ncan be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in\ntime and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the\ninflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have\ndifferent sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier\ninterference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an\nalternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to\nOFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of\nOFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS\npulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource\nallocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals\nand applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to\nindividual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between\nusers, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model\nrepresentative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate\nsingle-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing\nto provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users.\nThese performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable\nZak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink\ncommunication."}

With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna\narrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models\nwhere waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and\ncommunication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential\nprivacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which\nleverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only,\nthereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic\ncommunication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive\nmechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the\nNF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The\nproposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users\nand extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization\nproblem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing\nquality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating\noptimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three\nsub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio.\nBeamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA\npositioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)\nalgorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection\nsearch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nhigher data rates and better privacy preservation."}
