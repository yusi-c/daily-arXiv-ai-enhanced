This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

Geometric observations highlight\nthe unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal\nnoise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests.

The performance of a\nLUT can be optimized by incorporating a parametric model for the expected input\nsignal, noise level, and interference signals. We evaluate three analytical\nestimators for integration with parametrized LUTs, especially with applications\nto low-resolution, non-linear, or wideband quantizers. We also propose several\napproximations to improve tractability of the estimation problem for\nPhase-Shift Keyed input signals and Linear Frequency Modulated interference\nsignals. Simulated results validate the ability of our estimator to recover the\ninstantaneous value of the desired input signal in real-time with a high degree\nof accuracy. This includes cancellation of harmonic distortion that aliases\ninto the desired signal bandwidth from front-end saturation due to high-power\nout-of-band interference. Our estimators are shown to achieve a significant\ngain over conventional linear-filtering techniques while also being robust to\nchanges in input parameters, non-linear quantizers, and time-variant\ninterference sources. For a tone input quantized to 3 bits and estimated with a\nfixed 12-tap model order we achieve $>$10 dB improvement in Mean Square Error\nand $>$20 dBc improvement in Spurious-Free Dynamic Range."}

The inherent randomness in\ndiffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical\nimages and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a\npromising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current\ntraining and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven\ndistribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer\ntraining times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a\nnovel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a\nunified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces\na staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction\ntargets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention\nacross all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through\npre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate\nperformance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

Accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on\n  Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) 2025", "summary": "Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the\ncharacteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model\nrequires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often\ndifficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO\nprecoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter\nwhile dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy\nconsumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model\nsignificantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean\nsquared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation\nin data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds\ntraining samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine\nsimilarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work\nenables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing\nchallenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability\nto dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher\nlevel resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over\nenergy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness."}

To address\nthese issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset\ncontaining both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and\npropose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification\nand anatomical site information.
