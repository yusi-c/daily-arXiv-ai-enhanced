Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from\ntrained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues\nand acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other\nhand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL)\nmodels are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This\nwork proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised\npipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology.\nThere are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to\ngenerate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction\nmodel and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of\nNuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually\nannotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good\ngeneralization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly\navailable datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and\nweakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully\nsupervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent\nand explainable to physicians."}

Due to its non-convexity and complexity, the\nformulated optimization problem is challenging to solve directly.
