Taking\nchannel estimation error into account, we formulate a beamforming optimization\nproblem for multi-user MI underground emergency communications, which aims to\nminimize the power consumption under the constraints of sum rate and signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Based on the worst-case\noptimization criterion and the S-procedure, the non-convex optimization problem\nis transformed into convex and solved.

In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur\nfrequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware\nconfiguration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve\nrobust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In\nthis paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed\nto improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless\nenvironments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a\nphysics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics\nunderlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The\ndata-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically\ninvestigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed\nto leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide\nunder-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware\nmodel aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced\nsimilar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation\nframework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel\nmodeling to predict mmWave RSS.
