In this work, we propose a novel method for super-resolution\nand denoising of 4D Flow MRI based on the explicit solution of an inverse\nproblem formulated in the complex domain. Using clinically available magnitude\nand velocity images, we reconstruct complex-valued spatial signals and model\nresolution degradation as a convolution followed by subsampling. A fast,\nnon-iterative algorithm is employed to solve the inverse problem independently\nfor each velocity direction. We validate our method on synthetic data generated\nfrom computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and on physical phantom experiments\nacquired with 4D Flow MRI.

Prior works have shown that timestamps form a\ndiscrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as\nthe leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,\nconstructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of\nthe coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first\nnon-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key\ninnovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral\nbounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation\nof a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix\nconstruction, yielding up to $1000 \\times$ acceleration over existing methods.\nThe new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared\nwith the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the\ntime. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the\nmagnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in\nthe literature but are critical to the convergence."}

Submitted to IEEE journals for possible\n  publication", "summary": "Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna\nstructures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their\nability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing\nto their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy\ntransfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal\ncontinuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical\ndiscrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first\nharvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial\noffloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and\nthe remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),\neach examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each\nconfiguration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total\ncomputational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the\nTDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear\nproblems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions\nbased on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based\nlearning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed\ndesign in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing\nthat TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation\nlevels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior\ncomputation performance over NOMA."}

However, optimizing antenna\npositions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due\nto the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna\npositions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic\nalgorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local\noptima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and\nlow-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization.\nSpecifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling\npoints, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a\ndiscrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal\nsampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor\nlocal optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to\nexplore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study,\nwe investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an\nMA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework.
