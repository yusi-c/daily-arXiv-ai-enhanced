Such errors primarily stem from residual speckle\ncontrast associated with camera and shot noise, whose fluctuations exhibit a\ntemporal structure that mimics cerebral blood volume (CBV) waveforms. We\npropose an optimization-based framework that performs an adaptive refinement of\nnoise calibration, mitigating the CBV-mimicking artifacts by reducing the\nCBF-CBV waveform correlation.

A naive construction of\nthis adaptive birth set density results in an exponential number of newborn\ncomponents in the number of sensors. A truncation procedure was provided that\nleverages a Gibbs sampler to truncate the birth density, reducing the\ncomplexity to quadratic in the number of sensors. However, only a limited\ndiscussion has been provided on additional algorithmic techniques that can be\nemployed to substantially reduce the complexity in practical tracking\napplications. In this paper, we propose five efficiency enhancements for the\nlabeled random finite sets multi-sensor adaptive birth procedure. Simulation\nresults are provided to demonstrate their computational benefits and show that\nthey result in a negligible change to the multi-target tracking performance."}
