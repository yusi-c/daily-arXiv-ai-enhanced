This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and\ntemperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across\ndifferent corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in\nautomating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can\nadapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires\nmuch more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we\npropose a \\textbf{Goal-conditioned RL framework} that enables efficient policy\ntraining for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong\ngeneralization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce\nPareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum\nby sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This\nstrategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience\nReplay, which assigns relabeled goals with conservative virtual rewards to\nstabilize training and accelerate convergence.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nlanguage-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard\ncells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform\nprediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and\npropagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical\nparameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method\naccurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without\nrequiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,\nwe implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from\neach stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across\nthe logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete\nwaveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction\nutilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level\nencoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality\nconstraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary\ndelay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate\nSPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse\nindustrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally\nadaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines,\ndemonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors."}

We adopt a user-centric approach for communication user equipments\n(UEs) and a distributed sensing approach for multi-target detection. A\nheuristic access point (AP) mode selection algorithm and a channel-aware\ndistributed sensing scheme are proposed, where local measurements at receive\nAPs (RX-APs) are weighted based on the received signals signal-to-interference\nratio (SIR). A maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT) detector is applied\nunder two awareness levels at RX-APs. To balance the communication-sensing\ntrade-off, we develop a power allocation algorithm to jointly maximize the\nminimum detection probability and communication\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while satisfying power\nconstraints. The proposed scheme outperforms non-weighted methods. Adding test\nstatistics from more RX-APs can degrade sensing performance due to weaker\nchannels, but this effect can be mitigated by optimizing the weighting\nexponent. Additionally, assigning more sensing RX-APs to a sensing area results\nin approximately 10 dB loss in minimum communication SINR due to limited\ncommunication resources."}

Building on a previous single-target\nalgorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend\nit to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree,\nenabling scalable and efficient planning.\n  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with\nvarying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's\nfuture angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated\nrange and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform\ndesign via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to\nenhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring\nsufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to\nprioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.\n  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the\neffectiveness of our method.

A key challenge, however, is the blind spot problem caused by\nrandom phase offsets that corrupt the complementarity of respiratory signals.\nTo address the challenge, we propose a single-antenna-Wi-Fi-sensing\n(SA-WiSense) framework to improve accuracy of human respiration monitoring,\nrobust against random phase offsets. The proposed SA-WiSense framework is\ncost-efficient, as only a single antenna is used rather than multiple antennas\nas in the previous works. Therefore, the proposed framework is applicable to\nInternet of Thing (IoT), where most of sensors are equipped with a single\nantenna. On one hand, we propose a cross-subcarrier channel state information\n(CSI) ratio (CSCR) based blind spot mitigation approach for IoT, where the\nratios of two values of CSI between subcarriers are leveraged to mitigate\nrandom phase offsets. We prove that the random phase offsets can be cancelled\nby the proposed CSCR approach, thereby restoring the inherent complementarity\nof signals for blind-spot-free sensing. On the other hand, we propose a genetic\nalgorithm (GA) based subcarrier selection (GASS) approach by formulating an\noptimization problem in terms of the sensing-signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of\nCSCR between subcarriers. GA is utilized to solve the formulated optimization\nproblem. We use commodity ESP32 microcontrollers to build an experiment test.\nThe proposed works are validated to achieve an detection rate of 91.2% for\nrespiration monitoring at distances up to 8.0 meters, substantially more\naccurate than the state-of-the-art methods with a single antenna."}

The algorithm is based on a\nreformulation of the SMDS, originally developed in the real domain, using\nquaternion algebra. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method\nconstructs a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative\ndistance and angular information between nodes, which enhances the noise\nreduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation employing singular value\ndecomposition (SVD), thereby improving robustness against information loss. To\nfurther reduce computational complexity, we also propose a variant of QD-SMDS\nthat eliminates the need for the computationally expensive SVD by leveraging\nthe inherent structure of the quaternion-domain GEK matrix.
