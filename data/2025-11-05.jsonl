To mitigate the severe path loss\ninherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming\narchitectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral\nefficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO\nsystems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed\nobservations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and\nfar-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high\ncarrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing\nbased frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot\nfaithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,\nleading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a\ndiffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a\ndiffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid\nspherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,\nit leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM\nperforms inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the\nnumber of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.\nExperimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,\nattaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art\nschemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced\ncomputational efficiency."}

These limits can be avoided by measuring the\noncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use\npoint returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint\nalong a path.

The focus is on enhancing radar sensing\nperformance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance\ncharacteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection\nunder non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive\nestimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on\nthe RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is\nformulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication\nthroughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between\ndetection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived\nclosed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed\ncognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability\ncompared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining\ncompetitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of\nRL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation\nwireless networks."}

However, practical realization faces significant\nchallenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems\nand performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite\nblocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users\nwhile tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in\nboth communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to\nminimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via\nalternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results\nshow that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from\nfewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow\nmotion to degrade sensing. A \"sweet spot\" arises where blocklength and\nbeamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum\nin radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance,\nachieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly."}

Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31\nparameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate\nContour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the\nanalysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all\nfeature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between\nBaseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or\nFog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of\n13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced\ndifferences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze\nstability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as\nMean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index\n(GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the\nBCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye\nmovement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other\nparameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of\nsaccades: Cliff's $\\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and\nstandard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring\nthe influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability,\nwhile GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying\nvisibility conditions."}

The unknown\ninput is estimated in two stages within each time step.

We derive\nthe probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited\nsignals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution.\nSimulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same\nbit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both\namplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves\nlower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the\nadvantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an\nefficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes."}
