In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full\ncolumn rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing\ncodebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case\nbut limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a\nthree-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse\nBayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into\nsubarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about\nsubarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based\ndictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and\nemploying one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate\nthe central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion.\nFinally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined\nlocation-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using\nSBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm\ncompared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and\nestimation accuracy."}

However, this design presents\nchallenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its\nnon-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To\naddress this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions\nusing a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy\nwhile reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a\nsimplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths\nwith limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate\nshort-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a\nlow-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS\nstate vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various\nbaselines across a wide SNR range."}

The presence of\nmulti-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the\nchallenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often\nmakes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a\ncomprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of\nperformance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their\nrelative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of\nContention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based,\nFROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority\ntraffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated\nback-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early\ntransmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic.\nSimulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two\ntraffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority\nheterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both\nin terms of delay and throughput."}

While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)\nalgorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in\nthe number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its\napplication in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we\npropose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent\nframework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block\ncoordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely\non matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU\nacceleration.

Traditional performance modeling based\non multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO\nsatellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately\nevaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical\nframework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network\n(LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process\n(BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the\nend-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through\neither a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician\nfading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving\nsatellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the\ndestination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a\ndistance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a\nthreshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive\nanalytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and\naverage transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the\naccuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the\nperformance of LEO-SSCN."}
