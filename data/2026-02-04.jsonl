Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with high-resolution ground truth data, which is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on synthetic abundance data. The hyperspectral image is first decomposed into endmembers and abundance maps through hyperspectral unmixing. A neural network is then trained to super-resolve these maps using data generated with the dead leaves model, which replicates the statistical properties of real abundances. The final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by recombining the super-resolved abundance maps with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the relevance of synthetic data for training."}

The proposed approach combines a translation-based geometric mosaicking model with region-of-interest (ROI) based brightness correction and seam-aware feathering to improve radiometric consistency across large fields of view. The method relies on calibrated scan parameters and synchronized scan--camera control, without requiring image-content-based registration.

Quantitative evaluation shows that both scanning strategies demonstrate improved image quality, including enhanced brightness uniformity, increased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and reduced seam-related artifacts after image processing, while preserving a lateral resolution of $7.81~μ\\mathrm{m}$. Overall, the presented framework provides a practical and efficient solution for scan-based wide-field microscopic mosaicking."}

We further reveal that the great majority of QPSK-modulated symbols do not carry high-entropy user data but instead follow a regular tessellated structure superimposed on a constant reference template. We demonstrate that exploiting frame-level predictable elements yields a processing gain of approximately 48 dB, thereby enabling low-cost, compact receivers to extract precise TOA measurements even from low-SNR Starlink side beams."}

By enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can support full-space angle detection. This paper develops a fullspace angle estimation framework by leveraging a finite rate of innovation (FRI) model enabled by STAR-RIS. We distinguish two practical STAR-RIS configurations: (i) an element-wise uniform setting, where all metasurface elements share identical energy-splitting (ES) coefficients and phase differences, and (ii) a nonuniform ES setting, where the phase difference is common across elements while the ES coefficients vary element-wise to increase design flexibility. For each regime, we formulate the corresponding FRI-based signal model and derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) for angle estimation. To recover the underlying FRI sampling structure, we develop a proximal-gradient algorithm implemented via alternating projections in matrix space and establish its convergence. Exploiting the recovered FRI structure, we construct an annihilating filter whose zeros encode user angles, enabling gridless estimation via polynomial root finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods operate reliably across both configuration regimes and achieve improved angle estimation performance with low overhead."}

As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs."}

Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations."}

To address these limitations, this paper proposes the multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter. A unified Bayesian framework based on labeled random finite set theory is derived to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and the association between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. This formulation enables simultaneous trajectory estimation for both targets and reflectors without requiring heuristic post-processing. To enhance computational efficiency, a joint prediction and update implementation based on Gibbs sampling is developed. Furthermore, a measurement-driven adaptive birth model is introduced to initialize tracks without prior knowledge of target positions. Experimental results from simulated scenarios and real-world automotive radar data demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior state estimation accuracy and robust trajectory maintenance in dynamic multipath environments."}

Specifically, we reformulate the security optimization as a conditional generative process, using a diffusion model to learn the inherent distribution of near-optimal joint beamforming and AN strategies. We employ a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to integrate channel state information, as the basis for the generative process. Moreover, we fine-tune the trained model using an objective incorporating the sum secrecy rate such that the security performance is further enhanced. Finally, simulation results validate the learning process convergence and demonstrate that the proposed generative method achieves superior secrecy performance across various scenarios as compared with the baselines."}

VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks.

It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks."}
