However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans.\n  We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification.

While supervised deep learning has revolutionized this field, it relies heavily on large datasets of fully sampled ground-truth images, which are often impractical or impossible to acquire in clinical settings due to long scan times. Despite advances in self-supervised/unsupervised MRI reconstruction, their performance remains inadequate at high acceleration rates. To bridge this gap, we introduce UPMRI, an unsupervised reconstruction framework based on Projected Conditional Flow Matching (PCFM) and its unsupervised transformation. Unlike standard generative models, PCFM learns the prior distribution of fully sampled parallel MRI data by utilizing only undersampled k-space measurements. To reconstruct the image, we establish a novel theoretical link between the marginal vector field in the measurement space, governed by the continuity equation, and the optimal solution to the PCFM objective. This connection results in a cyclic dual-space sampling algorithm for high-quality reconstruction. Extensive evaluations on the fastMRI brain and CMRxRecon cardiac datasets demonstrate that UPMRI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Submitted for review to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing on December 18, 2025", "summary": "Recently, filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) technology has been proposed for use in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. It has been noted that, due to the spectral partitioning properties of the filter banks, a UWB signal can be synthesized and processed using a parallel set of signal processors operating at a moderate rate. This transceiver architecture can be used to generate UWB signals, without requiring a high-rate analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog converter. In this paper, beginning with a design operating on a single signal processor, we explore the development of a packet detector using the Rao score test. Taking advantage of the FBMC-SS signal structure, an effective detector design based on a cascade channelizer is proposed. We refer to this design as singe-radio band (SRB) detector. Given the typical bandwidth of UWB systems ($\\bf 500$~MHz or wider), the SRB detector has to operate at a fast sampling rate of greater than $\\bf 500$~MHz. This may be undesirable, as low cost analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are often limited to a sampling rate of $\\bf 200$~MHz or lower. Taking note of this point, the proposed SRB detector is extended to a multi-radio band (MRB) detector, where a set of parallel signal processors operating at a moderate sampling rate are used for a more practical implementation of the detector. Through computer simulations, we show that SRB and MRB detectors have the same performance in typical UWB channels. Finally, we provide results from an over-the-air demonstration of a UWB design occupying $\\bf 1.28$~GHz of bandwidth. We find that reliable detection performance is possible in the harshest environments, at signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\\bf -40$~dB with a preamble length of approximately half the duration of longest preamble length recommended in the IEEE802.15.4 standard."}

Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements."}

Synthetic melanoma images are assessed using established perceptual and distributional metrics (FID, KID, IS), feature space analysis, and their impact on diagnostic performance across five downstream classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that generative architecture choice has a stronger influence on both image fidelity and diagnostic utility than preprocessing complexity. StyleGAN2-ADA consistently produced synthetic images more closely aligned with real data distributions, achieving the lowest FID (~65.5) and KID (~0.05), while diffusion models generated higher variance samples at the cost of reduces perceptual fidelity and class anchoring. Advanced artifact removal yielded only marginal improvements in generative metrics and provided limited downstream diagnostic gains, suggesting possible suppression of clinically relevant texture cues. In contrast, synthetic data augmentation substantially improved melanoma detection with 8-15% absolute gains in melanoma F1-score, and ViT-B/16 achieving F1~0.88 and ROC-AUC~0.98, representing an improvement of approximately 14% over non-augmented baselines.

In this paper, we assume a non-linear, user's position-dependent system model, for a user with high mobility, an RIS with multiple elements, and a base station (BS) with multiple antennas. After that, we apply the Kalman Filtering (KF) like algorithms to reduce MSE in estimating parameters of this time-variant channel model. Additionally, we propose a Non-Circular Noise Kalman Filter (NCNKF) to address scenarios with non-circular complex state-space noise. Furthermore, we apply the Discrete Space Fourier Transform (DSFT) method, combined with the interpolation techniques to decrease the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the user localization based on the estimated CSI. Finally, we extend the single-user case into the multi-user situation. Results show that KF can achieve lower MSE in estimating the channel than other known approaches, while the NCNKF algorithm has better performance in non-circular state-space noise scenarios. At the same time, the DSFT interpolation outperforms the other approaches with lower complexity. The study concludes with numerical comparisons and an in-depth discussion of the performance improvements enabled by our approaches."}

Method: The proposed framework includes tumour segmentation, image registration, feature extraction, and predictive modelling. Using the image registration method, MRI image features can be extracted and compared from the original tumour site at different time points, therefore monitoring the intratumor changes during NACT process. Four feature extractors, including one radiomics and three deep learning-based (MedicalNet, Segformer3D, SAM-Med3D) were implemented and compared.

Classical multi-hypothesis likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are optimal for this task when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, yet in AmBC such CSI is difficult to obtain and track because the RF source is uncooperative and the tags are low-power passive devices. We first derive analytical performance bounds for an LRT receiver with perfect CSI to serve as a benchmark. We then propose two complementary deep learning frameworks that relax the CSI requirement while remaining modulation-agnostic. EmbedNet is an end-to-end prototypical network that maps covariance features of the received signal directly to multi-tag states. ChanEstNet is a hybrid scheme in which a convolutional neural network estimates effective channel coefficients from pilot symbols and passes them to a conventional LRT for interpretable multi-hypothesis detection. Simulations over diverse ambient sources and system configurations show that the proposed methods substantially reduce bit error rate, closely track the LRT benchmark, and significantly outperform energy detection baselines, especially as the number of tags increases."}

However, existing efforts focus primarily on increasing dataset size and overlook the question of whether the backbone network is an effective representation learner at scale. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting ConvNeXt-based architectures for volumetric segmentation and introducing MedNeXt-v2, a compound-scaled 3D ConvNeXt that leverages improved micro-architecture and data scaling to deliver state-of-the-art performance. First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied. In conclusion, our results establish MedNeXt-v2 as a strong backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.

Methods: We propose a denoising strategy that incorporates full noise statistics, including the noise power spectral density (PSD), by leveraging the BM4D algorithm. Furthermore, to exploit redundancy across the diffusion MRI dataset, BM4D is applied to principal components (PC) of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the entire DWI dataset, an approach we refer to as BM4D-PC.

Results: Overall, BM4D-PC presented the best results for the metrics PSNR, SSIM and RMSE on the in-silico experiments.

Such analog compression provides only partial access to the ELAA measurement, making it essential to design an analog combiner that can preserve pose-relevant signal components despite channel uncertainty and unit-modulus hardware constraints. To address this, we propose a predictive analog combining-assisted extended Kalman filter (PAC-EKF) framework, where the analog combiner can leverage the temporal correlation in the MS pose variation to capture the most informative signal components predictively. We then analyze fundamental performance limits via Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound and Fisher information matrix, explicitly quantifying how the analog combiner, array size, signal-to-noise ratio, and MS pose influence the pose information contained in the uplink observation. Building on these insights, we develop two methods for designing a low-complexity analog combiner.

Unlike far-field (FF) communication, which relies on a planar-wavefront model and is limited to angular-domain beamsteering, NF propagation exhibits spherical wavefronts that enable beamfocusing in both angle and distance, i.e., the polar domain, offering new opportunities for spatial multiple access. This paper develops an analytical stochastic geometry (SG) framework for a multi-user system assisted by polar-domain beamfocusing, which jointly captures NF propagation characteristics and the spatial randomness of user locations. The intrinsic coupling between angle and distance in the NF antenna pattern renders inter-user interference analysis intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a tractable near-field multi-level antenna pattern (NF-MLAP) approximation, which enables computationally efficient expressions and tight upper bounds for key performance metrics, including coverage probability, spectrum efficiency, and area spectrum efficiency.

This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications."}

However, applying Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to ECG signals presents a unique challenge: standard imperceptible noise constraints (e.g., 10 uV) fail to generate effective universal attacks due to the high inter-subject variability of cardiac waveforms. Furthermore, traditional \"invisible\" attacks are easily dismissed by clinicians as technical artifacts, failing to compromise the human-in-the-loop diagnostic pipeline. In this study, we propose SCAR (Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation), a novel UAP framework tailored to bypass the clinical \"Human Firewall.\" Unlike traditional approaches, SCAR integrates spatiotemporal smoothing (W=25, approx. 50ms), spectral consistency (<15 Hz), and anatomical amplitude constraints (<0.2 mV) directly into the gradient optimization manifold.\n  Results: We benchmarked SCAR against a rigorous baseline (Standard Universal DeepFool with post-hoc physiological filtering). While the baseline suffers a performance collapse (~16% success rate on transfer tasks), SCAR maintains robust transferability (58.09% on ResNet) and achieves 82.46% success on the source model. Crucially, clinical analysis reveals an emergent targeted behavior: SCAR specifically converges to forging Myocardial Infarction features (90.2% misdiagnosis) by mathematically reconstructing pathological ST-segment elevations. Finally, we demonstrate that SCAR serves a dual purpose: it not only functions as a robust data augmentation strategy for Hybrid Adversarial Training, offering optimal clinical defense, but also provides effective educational samples for training clinicians to recognize low-cost, AI-targeted semantic forgeries."}

In light of this, research has focused considerable attention on liquid antennas due to their unique characteristics, which include small size, flexibility, reconfigurability and transparency. Recently, graphene liquid has been explored for numerous applications due to its low cost, high conductivity, flexibility, and ease of processing. Specifically for antenna applications, graphene liquid performs better than conventional liquid metal. This paper presents a graphene-liquid antenna with beam reconfiguration ability for sub-6 GHz communication system. The graphene-liquid movement within the microfluidic channel is taken into consideration by the reconfiguration mechanism. The antenna achieves beam reconfiguration in 360° directions with 6 dBi of gain at 5.5 GHz, featuring a wideband impedance bandwidth of 24%. The antenna main beam is specifically reconfigured into six directions (0°, 45°, 135°, 180°, 225° and 315°) at 5.5 GHz. Additionally, in all six reconfigurable scenarios at 5.5 GHz, the antenna provides a stable reflection coefficient. Therefore, for the next generation of wireless communication systems, this novel design of graphene-liquid-based reconfigurable sub-6 GHz antennas holds promise."}

Code available from https://gitlab.com/Atharva05/admm-for-nmd", "summary": "We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \\ll \\min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ and $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$ such that $X \\approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \\max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \\min(b, \\max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications."}

On the other side, some references and also our studies demonstrate that AFDM involves an unneeded matrix, which is based on a parameter typically represented by $c_2$, for signalling. Hence, in this paper, an augmented AFDM scheme, referred to as A$^2$FDM, is proposed to mitigate the PAPR problem of AFDM, which is achieved by replacing the $c_2$ matrix in AFDM by a new unitary matrix that performs both sub-block-based Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and symbol mapping. Two symbol mapping schemes, namely interleaved mapping and localized mapping, are proposed for implementing A$^2$FDM, yielding the Interleaved A$^2$FDM and Localized A$^2$FDM. The input-output relationships of these schemes are derived and the complexity and the effects of system parameters on the performance of A$^2$FDM along with AFDM systems are analyzed. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to demonstrate and compare comprehensively the performance of the considered schemes in conjunction with different system settings and various operational conditions. Our studies and results demonstrate that, while A$^2$FDM is capable of circumventing the PAPR problem faced by AFDM, it is capable of attaining the achievable diversity gain, when AFDM is operated in its undesirable conditions resulting in the loss of the diversity gain available."}

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-destructive geophysical technique widely used to characterize subsurface conditions. Data-driven parameter estimation methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which is expensive to obtain from real-world GPR scans under diverse subsurface conditions. A physics-based GPR model using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be employed to generate large synthetic datasets through simulations across varying material parameters, which are then utilized to train data-driven models. A key limitation, however, is that simulated data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain) often follow different distributions, which can cause data-driven models trained on simulations to underperform in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation framework with deep adversarial learning for robust subsurface material property estimation from GPR signals. The proposed framework is systematically evaluated through the laboratory tests for single- and two-layer materials, as well as the field tests for single- and two-layer materials, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and domain adversarial neural network (DANN). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher correlation coefficients R and lower Bias between the predicted and measured parameter values, along with smaller standard deviations in the estimations, thereby validating their effectiveness in bridging the domain gap between simulated and real-world radar signals and enabling efficient subsurface material property retrieval."}

Unlike existing works, which only consider the preamble detection for a single target end devices (ED), we proposed to simultaneously detect the preambles of multiple EDs that asynchronously transmit their uplink (UL) packets to a multiple-antenna gateway (GW). First we show that the preamble detection in multiuser LoRa networks with the conventional single-chirp preamble suffers from the so-called preamble resemblance effect. This means that the preamble of any single ED can resemble the preambles of all EDs in the network, and make it impossible to determine to which ED a preamble belongs. To address this problem, a novel double-chirp preamble design and a preamble assignment method are proposed, which can mitigate the preamble resemblance effect by making the preamble of each ED unique and recognizable. Next, a maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection scheme for the proposed double-chirp preamble is derived. Finally, since the proposed algorithm requires the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) every sampling period, we proposed a low-complexity technique to calculate the DFT recursively to reduce the complexity of our proposed design. Simulation shows that the proposed preamble detection design and detection requires just about 2 dB more power to increase the number of EDs from one to 15 in the Rayleigh fading channel while achieving the same preamble detection error performance."}
