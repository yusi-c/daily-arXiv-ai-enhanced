One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep\napnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for\ndiagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,\noften resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel\napproach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy\nof 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a\nsignificant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations\nof PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also\ninclude the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an\nInfinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction\nmethod providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to\naddress class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of\ntransitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,\nautomated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the\naccessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics."}

Alternatively, scanning\nthe x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time\nand increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally\nimportant. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics\nof the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting\nregions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for\nraster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter\noptimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by\nreconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this\napproach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a\nlarge dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose\nleveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on\nregions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct\ndetails in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning\nprocess and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining\nhigh-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned\nimage. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a\nscore function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs,\nand (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to\nan optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning\npath between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently\napply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the\nnext scan iteration."}

Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has\ndemonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel\nconditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works\nhave explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the\ndiscrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the\nlimited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP\ntasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this\npaper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system\nfor image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO.

This work\npresents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at\n300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located\ntransceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios.\nMultipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle,\nare extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized\nexpectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an\nimage-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling\n(CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the\nmeasurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed\nto establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector\ngeometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding\nchannel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and\ndiffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection\nloss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to\ncharacterize reflection behavior.
