Accepted to ML4H 2025 (Proceedings)", "summary": "Radiology is essential to modern healthcare, yet rising demand and staffing shortages continue to pose major challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to support radiologists and help address these challenges. Given its widespread use and clinical importance, chest X-ray classification is well suited to augment radiologists' workflows. However, most existing approaches rely solely on single-view, image-level inputs, ignoring the structured clinical information and multi-image studies available at the time of reporting. In this work, we introduce CaMCheX, a multimodal transformer-based framework that aligns multi-view chest X-ray studies with structured clinical data to better reflect how clinicians make diagnostic decisions. Our architecture employs view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal and lateral chest radiographs, whose features are fused with clinical indications, history, and vital signs using a transformer fusion module. This design enables the model to generate context-aware representations that mirror reasoning in clinical practice. Our results exceed the state of the art for both the original MIMIC-CXR dataset and the more recent CXR-LT benchmarks, highlighting the value of clinically grounded multimodal alignment for advancing chest X-ray classification."}

However, state-of-the-art DL methods are prone to hallucinations, which can result in anatomically implausible segmentations. With manual correction impractical at scale, automated quality control (QC) techniques have to address the challenge. While promising, existing QC methods are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability beyond their original intended task. To overcome this limitation, we propose no-new Quality Control (nnQC), a robust QC framework based on a diffusion-generative paradigm that self-adapts to any input organ dataset. Central to nnQC is a novel Team of Experts (ToE) architecture, where two specialized experts independently encode 3D spatial awareness, represented by the relative spatial position of an axial slice, and anatomical information derived from visual features from the original image. A weighted conditional module dynamically combines the pair of independent embeddings, or opinions to condition the sampling mechanism within a diffusion process, enabling the generation of a spatially aware pseudo-ground truth for predicting QC scores. Within its framework, nnQC integrates fingerprint adaptation to ensure adaptability across organs, datasets, and imaging modalities. We evaluated nnQC on seven organs using twelve publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, including cases where segmentation masks are highly degraded or completely missing, confirming its versatility and effectiveness across different organs."}

However, their direct application to medical imaging remains challenging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artefacts, and low-contrast boundaries, particularly in tumours and cancer primaries leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous or overlapping lesion regions. Here, we present Segment Any Tumour 3D (SAT3D), a lightweight volumetric foundation model designed to enable robust and generalisable tumour segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities. SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with an uncertainty-aware training pipeline that explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates as prompts to guide reliable boundary prediction in low-contrast regions. Adversarial learning further enhances model performance for the ambiguous pathological regions. We benchmark SAT3D against three recent vision foundation models and nnUNet across 11 publicly available datasets, encompassing 3,884 tumour and cancer cases for training and 694 cases for in-distribution evaluation. Trained on 17,075 3D volume-mask pairs across multiple modalities and cancer primaries, SAT3D demonstrates strong generalisation and robustness. To facilitate practical use and clinical translation, we developed a 3D Slicer plugin that enables interactive, prompt-driven segmentation and visualisation using the trained SAT3D model. Extensive experiments highlight its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under challenging and out-of-distribution scenarios, underscoring its potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis."}

We contribute a new benchmark dataset of 9,810 low-resolution temporal images paired with high-resolution labels from an existing river monitoring dataset. Using this benchmark, we investigate multiple strategies for river segmentation, including ensembling single-image models, applying image super-resolution, and developing end-to-end models trained on temporal sequences. SuperRivolution significantly outperforms single-image methods and baseline temporal approaches, narrowing the gap with supervised high-resolution models. For example, the F1 score for river segmentation improves from 60.9% to 80.5%, while the state-of-the-art model operating on high-resolution images achieves 94.1%. Similar improvements are also observed in river width estimation tasks. Our results highlight the potential of publicly available low-resolution satellite archives for fine-scale river monitoring."}

Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios."}

This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions.

However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation.

To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups."}

This significantly improves model robustness to diverse lighting scenarios and eases training optimization, leading to better denoising performance. For enhanced temporal coherence, we propose a multi-scale temporal consistency-aware loss to enforce multiscale similarity between consecutive frames, and an occlusion-aware masking technique to handle complex motions. We further incorporate a reverse inference strategy to refine unconverged frames and a self-ensemble (SE) mechanism to boost the denoising across diverse textures.

Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer."}

However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images.

The usage of appropriate constraints can restrict the solution space, thus making it feasible for a reconstruction algorithm to find a meaningful solution. In recent years, deep network based ideas aimed at learning the end-to-end mapping between the raw measurements and the target image have gained popularity. In the learning approach, the functional relationship between the measured raw data and the solution image are learned by training a deep network with prior examples. While this approach allows one to significantly increase the real-time operational speed, it does not change the nature of the underlying ill-posed inverse problem. It is well-known that availability of diverse non-redundant data via additional measurements can generically improve the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms. The multiple data measurements, however, typically demand additional hardware and complex system setups that are not desirable. In this work, we note that in both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, the irradiance patterns corresponding to two phase diverse measurements associated with the same test object have implicit local correlation which may be learned. A physics informed data augmentation scheme is then described where a trained network is used for generating a phase diverse pseudo-data based on a ground truth data frame. The true data along with the augmented pesudo-data are observed to provide high quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms. We validate this approach for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging (or phase retrieval) configurations with vortex phase as a diversity mechanism.

Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of bandwidth.To address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval\n  mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline."}

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose two unified frameworks named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) and Equivariant Plug-and-Play (EPnP) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithms and discuss their practical benefit."}

In learning-based perception algorithms, characteristics occurring during the application phase, but absent in the training data, lead to a domain gap impeding the performance. Previously, pixel-level domain adaptation through unpaired learning of the pristine-to-distorted mapping function has been proposed. In this work, we propose shallow discriminator architectures to address limitations of these approaches. We show that a smaller receptive field size improves learning of unknown image distortions by more accurately reproducing local distortion characteristics at a low network complexity. In a domain adaptation setup for instance segmentation, we achieve mean average precision increases over previous methods of up to 0.15 for individual distortions and up to 0.16 for camera-specific image characteristics in a simplified camera model. In terms of number of parameters, our approach matches the complexity of one state of the art method while reducing complexity by a factor of 20 compared to another, demonstrating superior efficiency without compromising performance."}
