However, existing\ndistributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary\nprobability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model\nat the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead.

This method performs estimation\nof probability mass functions by coupling 3D marginals, seen as order-3\ntensors. The core novelty of PCTF3D's approach (detailed in the part I article)\nrelies on the partial coupling which consists on the choice of 3D marginals to\nbe coupled. Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical\nlearning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties.\nIn this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled\nlow-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled\nmodel are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the\ncoupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum\nrecoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article\nare examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an\nidentifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits\nenhancing sufficient bounds of the literature."}

In this paper, we introduce ROPE,\nwhich, to the best of our knowledge, is the first phase-estimation algorithm\ncapable of (i) handling signals of arbitrary dimension and (ii) operating in\nreal-time, with minimal error. ROPE identifies repetitions within the signal to\nsegment it into (pseudo-)periods and assigns phase values by performing\nefficient, tractable searches over previous signal segments. We extensively\nvalidate the algorithm on a variety of signal types, including trajectories\nfrom chaotic dynamical systems, human motion-capture data, and\nelectrocardiographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that ROPE is robust\nagainst noise and signal drift, and achieves significantly superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art phase estimation methods. This advancement enables\nreal-time analysis of complex biological rhythms, opening new pathways, for\nexample, for early diagnosis of pathological rhythm disruptions and developing\nrhythm-based therapeutic interventions in neurological and cardiovascular\ndisorders."}

F. Moura"], "title": "Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid\ngraph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring\npixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values\n(intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input\nto graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph\nCNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the\nimages. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural\nnetwork tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel\nmethods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We\nfind row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in\nMNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on\nthe method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph\nrepresentations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the\naccuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the\nliterature."}
