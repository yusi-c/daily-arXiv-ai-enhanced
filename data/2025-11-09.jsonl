However, it remains challenging to\ngenerate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across\ndifferent patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the\nlearning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function\nwith only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness\nregularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and\nelement quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad\nmeshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh\ncorrespondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus\nenhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling."}
