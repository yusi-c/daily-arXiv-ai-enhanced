This bit budget imposes a\ntrade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy\nconsumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit\ndepth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with\nlow-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with\nSigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,\nSDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to\nhandle inputs with arbitrary DR.

However, their\ncomplex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based\nsystems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of\nDML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on\nexperimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and\nequalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF)\npower applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization\nscheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different\nbenchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The\nresults show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better\nperformance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances\nwhile employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a\nsmaller signal bandwidth."}

Our proposed scheme remains\neffective even in the presence of active adversaries attempting impersonation\nattacks to disrupt the authentication process. Specifically, we introduce a\ntag-based PLA CFmMIMO system, wherein the access points (APs) first estimate\ntheir channels with the legitimate users during an uplink training phase.\nSubsequently, a unique secret key is generated and securely shared between each\nuser and the APs. We then formulate a hypothesis testing problem and derive a\nclosed-form expression for the probability of detection for each user in the\nnetwork. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\ndemonstrating that it maintains a high detection probability even as the number\nof users in the system increases."}

Its architecture comprises a fast spectral similarity layer based\non cosine similarity metrics of Fourier-transformed signals, and a sparse\ntime-frequency layer for wavelet coherence. The system constructs and evolves a\nmultilayer graph representing inter-signal relationships, enabling low-latency\ninference and monitoring. A simulation prototype demonstrates functionality\nacross 8 synthetic channels with a high similarity threshold for further\ncomputation, with additional opportunities for scaling the architecture up to\nsupport thousands of input signals with constrained hardware.
