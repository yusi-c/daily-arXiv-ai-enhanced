Motivated by biomedical imaging\napplications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our\napproach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation\nto extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to\nreconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the\ncomputational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a\nvariational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image\nsegmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified\nCahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the\nreconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,\napproximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo\nintegration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational\nobjective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to\nthe variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces\nhigh-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice\ndata is sparse and noisy."}

However, these gains come at the cost of severe path loss\nand a heightened risk of beam misalignment due to user mobility, especially\npronounced in near-field communication. Traditional solutions rely on extremely\ndirectional beamforming and frequent beam updates via beam management, but such\ntechniques impose formidable computational and signaling overhead. In response,\nwe propose a novel approach termed trajectory-adaptive beam shaping (TABS) that\neliminates the need for real-time beam management by shaping the\nelectromagnetic wavefront to follow the user's predefined trajectory. Drawing\ninspiration from self-accelerating beams in optics, TABS concentrates energy\nalong pre-defined curved paths corresponding to the user's motion without\nrequiring real-time beam reconfiguration. We further introduce a dedicated\nquantitative metric to characterize performance under the TABS framework.\nComprehensive simulations substantiate the superiority of TABS in terms of link\nperformance, overhead reduction, and implementation complexity."}

This decoupling enables coordinated yet independently\nconfigurable designs in the AMAF and T-RIS domains, supporting flexible\nstrategies with diverse complexity-performance trade-offs. Several\nimplementations are analyzed, including diagonal and non-diagonal T-RIS\narchitectures, paired with precoding schemes based on focusing, minimum mean\nsquare error, and eigenmode decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate that\nwhile non-diagonal schemes maximize sum rate in scenarios with a limited number\nof User Equipments (UEs) and high angular separability, they exhibit fairness\nand scalability limitations as UE density increases. Conversely, diagonal T-RIS\nconfigurations, particularly the proposed focusing-based scheme with uniform\nfeeder-side power allocation, offer robust, fair, and scalable performance with\nminimal channel state information. The findings emphasize the critical impact\nof UEs' angular separability and reveal inherent trade-offs among spectral\nefficiency, complexity, and fairness, positioning diagonal AT-RIS architectures\nas practical solutions for scalable near-field MU multiple-input single-output\nsystems."}

To this\npoint, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral\nEfficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new\nsystem metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric\nquantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access\nMethod, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We\ncompare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO\ndeployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin\nby providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three\ncategories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix\nrank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example\nRadio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%\n(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical\nlimitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)\nmeasurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are\ncharacterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine\nLearning (ML) based techniques.

While many methods address complex spectral\nvariability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by\nfactors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major\nchallenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate\nmodel fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that\ncorrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and\ncompensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm\nprovides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively\non modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present\na rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive\nexperimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's\nimpact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed\npreprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,\nincluding those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with\nerror reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale\ncorrection acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by\nexisting methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight\nits potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.\nThe implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication."}
