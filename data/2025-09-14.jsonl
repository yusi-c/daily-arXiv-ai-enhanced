However, the\nphysical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,\nrestricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this\nwork, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework\nto accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.\nWe train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber\ncontraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from\ncine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function\ncomposed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the\nwarped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of\ncardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the\ndirection of synthetically produced fibers.

We then develop a constructive multi-band\nsampling scheme that attains this bound. The proposed method operates via\nspectral partitioning of the latent sources, followed by spatio-temporal\nsampling and interpolation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm\nthat our scheme achieves near-lossless reconstruction precisely at the\ntheoretical sampling density, validating its efficiency."}

The presence of artifacts can\nsignificantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially\nleading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods\nhave been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human\nexperts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for\nlarge-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong\nreliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato\nField (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that\naddresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against\nseveral state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly\navailable EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG\nrecordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors\nacross multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in\nspecificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation\nForest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,\nrespectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these\nimprovements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most\ncomparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact\ncleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,\nhighlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time\napplications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution\nfor high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical\nneuroimaging applications."}

This enables the analysis and comparison of\ndifferent structures using a common basis of characteristic modes.\nAdditionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation\nmatrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal\ntransformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the\ncharacteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures.\nThis matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different\nbases. Finally, two examples are provided along with a discussion of some\naspects of the theory. The first example aims to validate and illustrate the\nformalism. The second example shows how the formalism can be applied in the\ndesign process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from\na base structure."}

However, this innovation\nintroduces challenges for channel estimation and analog precoding due to the\nstate-non-separable channel response problem. This paper explores a multiuser\nMIMO-OFDM system utilizing pixel-based fluid antennas, informed by measurements\nfrom a real-world prototype. We present a sparse channel recovery framework for\nuplink channel sounding, employing an approximate separable channel response\nmodel with DNN-based antenna radiation functions. We then propose two\nlow-complexity channel estimation algorithms that leverage orthogonal matching\npursuit and variational Bayesian inference to accurately recover channel\nresponses across various scattering cluster angles. These estimations enable\nthe prediction of composite channels for all fluid antenna states, leading to\nan analog precoding scheme that optimally selects switching states for\ndifferent antennas. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach\nsignificantly outperforms several baseline methods, especially in high\nsignal-to-noise ratio environments with numerous users."}

While deep learning approaches\nhave shown strong potential, their generalization across diverse environments,\nrobustness to noisy inputs, and sensitivity to UAV altitude remain\nunderexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a UNet-based deep\nlearning architecture that combines multi-scale feature extraction,\nconvolution-based feature fusion, and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)\nbottleneck for efficient context aggregation. The model predicts pathloss maps\nfrom log-distance, line-of-sight (LOS) mask, and building mask inputs. In\naddition, we develop a fully vectorized LOS mask computation algorithm that\nsignificantly accelerates pre-processing and enables large-scale dataset\ngeneration. Extensive evaluations on both in-house ray-tracing data and the\nRadioMapSeer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and efficiency.
