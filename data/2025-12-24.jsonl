Distinct from conventional joint modulation schemes, our approach establishes two logically independent transmission channels--SFM and DBM--thereby eliminating the need for joint signal design or time synchronization. Specifically, the orthogonality of vortex wave modes is exploited to construct a high-capacity multi-mode DBM channel, in which each mode carries modulated symbols independently. As the composite waveform passes through the PMS, energy from different vortex modes is spatially focused onto distinct positions, dynamically determined by the PMS configuration. This spatial mapping forms a unique lookup table that encodes additional information in the electro-magnetic (EM) field distribution, effectively enabling a second, concurrent SFM channel. To enhance physical-layer security, the DBM channel transmits encrypted symbols transformed via dynamic symbol-domain mapping, while the corresponding mapping relations--or key information--are carried by the SFM channel. This lightweight dual-channel encryption strategy provides strong confidentiality without requiring complex joint decoding. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system, and conduct experimental demonstrations under real-world wireless communication conditions. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the co-existent DBM-SFM design in achieving reliable and secure transmission. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for future IoT networks, especially in scenarios demanding both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality."}

Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods."}

Unauthorized sensing eavesdroppers (Eve) can potentially exploit the ISAC signal for their own independent passive sensing. However, solutions for sensing-secure ISAC remain largely unexplored to date. This work addresses sensing-security for OFDM- and OTFS-based ISAC waveforms from a target-detection perspective, aiming to prevent Eves from exploiting the ISAC signal for unauthorized passive sensing. We develop ISAC system models for the base station (BS), communication user equipment, and the sensing Eve, and define a Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based detection metric that accounts for mainlobe, sidelobe, and noise components in the ambiguity function and the resulting range-Doppler maps of the legitimate BS's and Eve's sensing. Building on this analysis, we formulate a sensing-secure ISAC signaling design problem that tunes a perturbation matrix to jointly control signal amplitude and phase in the time-frequency domain and solve it via simulated annealing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme substantially degrades Eve's detection probability -- from 79.4% to 37.4% for OTFS and from 94.3% to 33.0% for OFDM -- while incurring only a small loss in BS sensing performance. In addition, it allows controllable trade-offs across sensing-security and communication performance."}

Specifically, we establish a rigorous system model capturing execution uncertainty via Gamma-distributed computational workloads, resulting in challenging nonlinear optimization problems involving complex Gamma functions. For single-user scenarios, we design advanced block coordinate descent (BCD) and majorization-maximization (MM) algorithms, which yield semi-closed-form solutions with provable performance guarantees. However, conventional optimization approaches become computationally intractable in dynamic multi-user environments due to inter-user interference and resource contention. To this end, we introduce a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based DRL framework capable of adaptively learning optimal policies through environment interaction. Our dual methodology effectively bridges analytical tractability with adaptive intelligence, leveraging optimization for foundational insight and learning for real-time adaptability. Extensive numerical results corroborate the performance gains achieved via increased edge server density and validate the superiority of our optimization-to-learning paradigm in next-generation AirComp systems."}

DualSpaceCMR couples image-level transforms with kspace noise and motion simulations while preserving forwardmodel consistency. VQPrompt adds a lightweight bottleneck prompt; Moero embeds a sparse mixture of experts within a deep unrolled network with histogram-based routing.\n  In the multivendor, multisite CMRxRecon25 benchmark, we evaluate fewshot and out-of-distribution generalization. On small datasets, k-space motion-plus-noise improves reconstruction; on the large benchmark it degrades performance, revealing sensitivity to augmentation ratio and schedule. VQPrompt produces modest and consistent gains with negligible memory overhead. Moero continues to improve after early plateaus and maintains baseline-like fewshot and out-of-distribution behavior despite mild overfitting, but sparse routing lowers PyTorch throughput and makes wall clock time the main bottleneck. These results motivate scale-aware augmentation and suggest prompt-based capacity scaling as a practical path, while efficiency improvements are crucial for sparse expert models."}

In this work, we study an edge-cloud-expert cascaded LLM-based knowledge system that supports decision-making through a question-and-answer pipeline. In it, an efficient edge model handles routine queries, a more capable cloud model addresses complex cases, and human experts are involved only when necessary. We define a misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize average processing cost, while guaranteeing alignment of automated answers with expert judgments. We propose a statistically rigorous threshold selection method based on multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for a query processing mechanism based on knowledge and confidence tests. The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on misalignment risk. Experiments on the TeleQnA dataset -- a telecom-specific benchmark -- demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels."}

However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface."}

Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid."}

To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines."}

This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data.
