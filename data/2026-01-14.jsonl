The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications."}

Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning."}

In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes."}

However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap.

Traditional methods, such as ray tracing and model-based approaches, often face challenges due to high computational complexity and discrepancies between models and real-world environments. In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering accurate path loss predictions with reduced computational complexity. In our research, we introduce a ResNet-based model designed to enhance path loss prediction. We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023.

Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.\n  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice."}

Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude."}

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments."}

While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF."}
