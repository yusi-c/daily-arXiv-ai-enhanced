It is demonstrated that a first-order HMM\nprovides a natural framework for the decoder. The HMM is time-homogeneous with\na fixed transition matrix and is based on a random walk through the encoded\nframe bits. Each hidden state contains a pair of two encoded bits, and parity\nchecks are naturally incorporated into the observation model. The paper shows\nthat by implementing a forward-backward smoothing estimator for the hidden\nstates, decoding is efficient and requires only a small number of iterations in\nmost cases. The results show that the LDPC decoding threshold is significantly\nimproved compared to belief propagation (BP) on a Tanner graph. Numerical\nresults are presented showing that LDPC codes under the proposed decoder yield\na frame error rate (FER) and decoding threshold comparable to that of a Polar\ncode where Successive Cancellation List (SCL) - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\ndecoding is deployed. This is shown to be achieved even if the frame length is\nshort (on the order of $512$ bits or less) and a regular LDPC code is used. 1"}

To address both challenges, we develop a\nSIM-enhanced wideband multiuser transceiver built on orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM). The sparse\nactivation of OFDM-IM confines high-fidelity equalization to the active tones,\neffectively widening the usable bandwidth. To make the design\nreliability-aware, we directly target the worst-link bit-error rate (BER) and\nadopt a max-min per-tone signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a\nprincipled surrogate, turning the reliability optimization tractable. For\nframe-rate inference and interpretability, we propose an unfolded\nprojected-gradient-descent network (UPGD-Net) that double-unrolls across the\nSIM's layers and algorithmic iterations: each cell computes the analytic\ngradient from the cascaded precoder with a learnable per-iteration step size.\nSimulations on wideband multiuser downlinks show fast, monotone convergence, an\nevident layer-depth sweet spot, and consistent gains in worst-link BER and sum\nrate.
