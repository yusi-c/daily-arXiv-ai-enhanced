Here, we propose the use of the distribution\nof intrinsic frequencies derived from DMDs (DM frequencies) to characterise\nneural activities. The distributions of DM frequencies in the\nelectroencephalograms of healthy subjects and patients with dementia or\nParkinson's disease in a resting state were evaluated. By using the\ndistributions, these patients were distinguished from healthy subjects with\nsignificantly greater accuracy than when using amplitude spectra derived by\ndiscrete Fourier transform. This finding suggests that the distribution of DM\nfrequencies exhibits distinct behaviour from amplitude spectra, and therefore,\nthe distribution may serve as a new biomarker by characterising the nonlinear\nspatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological signals."}

By pre-installing multiple pinching antennas\nat discrete positions along a waveguide, the capability of the considered\nsystem to perform amplitude and phase adjustment is validated through the\nformulation of a secrecy rate maximization problem. Specifically, amplitude\ncontrol is applied to enhance the signal quality at the legitimate user, while\nphase alignment is designed to degrade the received signal quality at the\neavesdropper. This cooperation among pinching antennas is modeled as a\ncoalitional game, and a corresponding antenna activation algorithm is proposed.\nThe individual impact of each antenna is quantified based on the Shapley value\nand marginal contribution, providing a fair and efficient method for\nperformance evaluation. Simulation results show that the considered\npinching-antenna system achieves significant improvements in secrecy rate, and\nthat the Shapley value based algorithm outperforms conventional coalition value\nbased solutions."}

Specifically, pinching antennas are pre-installed at preconfigured\npositions along waveguides and can be selectively activated to create LoS links\nfor enhancing desired signals and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links for\neliminating inter-user interference. On this basis, a sum-rate maximization\nproblem is formulated by jointly optimizing waveguide assignment and antenna\nactivation. To solve this problem, a matching based algorithm is proposed using\ntwo distinct preference designs. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nconsidered pinching-antenna system and proposed solutions can dynamically\nestablish LoS links and effectively exploit LoS blockages to mitigate\ninterference, thereby significantly improving system throughput."}

Urban settings, characterized by dense obstructions, together with UE\nmobility, and the dynamic movement and coverage of LSats pose significant\nchallenges to user association and resource allocation. To address these\nchallenges, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem designed to\nimprove both throughput and seamless handover (HO). Particularly, the\nformulated problem balances sum-rate (SR) maximization and connection change\n(CC) minimization through a weighted trade-off by jointly optimizing power\nallocation and BS-UE/LSat-UE associations over a given time window. This is a\nmixed-integer and non-convex problem which is inherently difficult to solve. To\nsolve this problem efficiently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the\nSuccessive Convex Approximation (SCA) technique. Furthermore, we introduce a\npractical prediction-based algorithm capable of providing efficient solutions\nin real-world implementations. Especially, the simulations use a realistic 3D\nmap of London and UE routes obtained from the Google Navigator application to\nensure practical examination. Thanks to these realistic data, the simulation\nresults can show valuable insights into the link budget assessment in urban\nareas due to the impact of buildings on transmission links under the blockage,\nreflection, and diffraction effects. Furthermore, the numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in terms of SR and the\nCC-number compared to the greedy and benchmark algorithms."}
