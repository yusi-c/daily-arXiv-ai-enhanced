However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious \"cropping-implies-degradation\" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales."}

Clinical imaging modalities are limited: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) captures the root but has a noisy, low-resolution crown, while Intraoral Scanners (IOS) provide a high-fidelity crown but no root information. A naive fusion of these sources results in unnatural seams and artifacts. We propose a novel, fully-automated pipeline that fuses CBCT and IOS data using a deep implicit representation. Our method first segments and robustly registers the tooth instances, then creates a hybrid proxy mesh combining the IOS crown and the CBCT root. The core of our approach is to use this noisy proxy to guide a class-specific DeepSDF network. This optimization process projects the input onto a learned manifold of ideal tooth shapes, generating a seamless, watertight, and anatomically coherent model. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show our method uniquely preserves both the high-fidelity crown from IOS and the patient-specific root morphology from CBCT, overcoming the limitations of each modality and naive stitching."}

However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues. We evaluate ASUKA using the Places2 dataset and MISATO, our proposed diverse benchmark. Experiments show that ASUKA effectively suppresses object hallucination and improves color consistency, outperforming standard diffusion, rectified flow models, and other inpainting methods.

Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet). We hope this work can spur future research on unified modeling."}

This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that direct pixel-level learning captures diagnostic patterns beyond handcrafted features and that purpose-built lightweight architectures can outperform large pretrained models for small, domain-specific medical datasets."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a robust statistical-CSI-based optimization framework for downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with FIM-assisted transmitters. A block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize power allocation and FIM morphing, maximizing the average achievable sum rate.

However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems."}

This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference."}

A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization."}

This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance."}

The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments.

By revisiting the convergence analysis of iterative reconstruction algorithms for non-uniform measurements, we derive a local, energy-based sufficient condition that governs reconstruction behavior as a function of the signal and derivative energies within each sampling interval. Unlike classical approaches that impose a global Nyquist-type bound on the inter-sample spacing, the proposed condition permits large gaps in slowly varying regions while enforcing denser sampling only where the signal exhibits rapid temporal variation. Building on this theoretical insight, we design a variable-bias, variable-threshold integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (VBT-IF-TEM) whose firing mechanism is explicitly shaped to enforce the derived local convergence condition. To ensure robustness, a shifted-signal formulation is introduced to suppress excessive firing in regions where the magnitude of the signal amplitude is close to zero or the local signal energy approaches zero. Using the proposed encoder, an analog signal is discretely represented by time encodings and signal averages, enabling perfect reconstruction via a standard iterative algorithm even when the local sampling rate falls below the Nyquist rate. Simulation results on synthetic signals and experiments on ultrasonic guided-wave and ECG signals demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves substantial reductions in sampling density compared to uniform sampling and conventional IF-TEMs, while maintaining accurate reconstruction. The results further highlight a controllable tradeoff between sampling density, reconstruction accuracy, and convergence behavior, which can be navigated through adaptive parameter selection."}

The block sparse mapping pattern is able to concentrate the transmit power in a small number of non-zero blocks thus improving the decoding accuracy, while the single-element sparse mapping pattern ensures that the code length does not increase dramatically with the number of transmitted information bits.

The problem formulation is similar to an active radar that uses a noise-like waveform, or an integrated sensing and communication application. The available data is first split into batches of manageable size. In the direct approach, the target's time-delay and Doppler parameters are estimated jointly by incoherently combining the batch-wise data. We propose a new method to estimate the time-delay separately, thus avoiding a costly 2-D search. Our approach is designed for slowly moving targets, and the accuracy of the time-delay estimate is similar to that of the full batch-wise 2-D method. Given the time-delay, the coherency between batches can be restored when estimating the Doppler parameter. Thereby, the separable approach is found to yield superior Doppler estimates over a wide parameter range. In addition to reducing computational complexity, the proposed separable estimation technique also significantly reduces the communication overhead in a distributed radar setting."}

To support flexible spatial processing and meet the demands of latency critical applications, it is essential to use fully digital mmWave MIMO beamforming, which relies on accurate channel estimation. However, ensuring power efficiency in fully digital mmWave MIMO systems requires the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The reduced resolution of these quantizers introduces distortion in both transmitted and received signals, ultimately degrading system performance. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation performance of mmWave MIMO systems employing fully digital beamforming with low-resolution quantization, under practical system constraints. We evaluate the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results demonstrate that a moderate quantization resolutions of 4-bit per DAC/ADC offers a favorable trade-off between energy consumption and achievable data rate."}

To investigate the propagation effects and small-scale fading differences between mmWave and conventional centimeter wave (cmWave) bands, multi-band channel measurements have to be conducted. One key parameter to characterize small-scale fading is the Rician K-factor. In this paper, we analyze the time-varying K-factor of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channels across multiple frequency bands, measured in an urban street environment. Specifically, we investigate three frequency bands with center frequencies of 3.2 GHz, 34.3 GHz and 62.35 GHz using measurement data with 155.5 MHz bandwidth and a sounding repetition rate of 31.25 μs. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between K-factor and root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread. We show that the Ricean K-factor is similar at different frequency bands and that is correlated with the RMS delay spread."}

Simultaneously, new imaging techniques such as quantitative phase imaging (QPI) are being developed to capture richer cell information with less sample preparation. So far, the two worlds of WSI and QPI have not been combined. In this work, we present a reconstruction algorithm which makes whole slide imaging of cervical smears possible by using a self-referencing three-wave digital holographic microscope. Since a WSI is constructed by combining multiple patches, the algorithm is adaptive and can be used on partial holograms and patched holograms. We present the algorithm for a single shot hologram, the adaptations to make it flexible to various inputs and show that the algorithm performs well for the tested epithelial cells. This is a preprint of our paper, which has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)."}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "We study the performance scaling laws for electrical-domain combining in photodetector (PD) array-based receivers employing intensity modulation and direct detection, taking into account the inherent square-law relationship between the optical and electrical received powers. The performance of PD array-based systems is compared, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate, to that of a reference receiver employing a single PD. Analytical and numerical results show that PD arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams and above an SNR threshold. Furthermore, increasing the number of PDs alone does not enhance performance, and joint optimization of beam pattern, transverse electromagnetic mode, received power, and PD positions is necessary. Our model and derived insights provide practical guidelines and highlight the trade-offs for the design of next-generation high-bandwidth PD array receivers."}

Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference.\n  We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions."}

However, conventional SSC schemes often suffer from high encoding and decoding complexity due to the use of dense codebook matrices. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SSC scheme by designing a sparse codebook structure, where each codeword contains only a small number of non-zero elements. The decoding is performed using the traditional multipath matching pursuit algorithm, and the overall complexity is significantly reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the codebook. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a favorable trade-off between BLER performance and computational complexity, and exhibits strong robustness across different transmission block lengths."}

In particular, the impact of quantized phase-feedback is studied while the amplitude is assumed estimated exactly. The scheme enables selecting the estimation precision of amplitude and phase separately, depending on the importance of each. Two variants of the scheme are proposed: As shown through simulations and theory, the second variant with reciprocity-based estimation of the channel phase, and optimal quantization of phase feedback, can outperform the first variant estimating the phase by feedback only."}
