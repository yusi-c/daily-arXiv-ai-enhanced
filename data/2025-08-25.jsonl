Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on\ndirectional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal\nprocessing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are\nconstrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of\nspatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable\nantenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation\npatterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain.\nSpecifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual\nangular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain\nand BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex\noptimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm\nleveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM),\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and\nBB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC\nsystems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over\nconventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained.\nThese results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly\nleveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure\nISAC system design."}

However, applying these methods to medical\nimaging is challenging due to the scarcity of data, given the high acquisition\ncosts and intricate data characteristics of those images, thereby limiting the\nfull potential of deep neural networks. To address the lack of data,\naugmentation techniques leverage geometry, color, and the synthesis ability of\ngenerative models (GMs). Despite previous efforts, gaps in the generation\nprocess limit the impact of data augmentation to improve understanding of\nmedical images, e.g., the highly structured nature of some domains, such as\nX-ray images, is ignored. Current GMs rely solely on the network's capacity to\nblindly synthesize augmentations that preserve semantic relationships of chest\nX-ray images, such as anatomical restrictions, representative structures, or\nstructural similarities consistent across datasets. In this paper, we introduce\na novel GM that leverages the structural resemblance of medical images by\nlearning a latent graph representation (LGR).

The methylation status\nof the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical\nbiomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the\nalkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation\nstatus using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the\ncomplex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven\ncontrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This\nstudy introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status\nPrediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to\nenhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,\ngenerating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively\ncaptures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different\nMRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a\nconvolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The\nadaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as\ncontrast differences and tumor locations in MR images.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps.
