One significant change is that agents,\ninstead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in\nthe future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native\ncommunication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability\nof large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a\npotential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language,\nwhich is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In\nthis paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.\nSpecifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine\nlanguage represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is\ntrained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit\ninformation from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine\nlanguage tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for\ntransmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission\noverhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that\ncompresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing\nrobustness against channel noise.

While prior datasets have relied on\nstructured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full\nexpressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to\nspatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This\naddresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,\ndescriptive text, such as \"3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe\", to its precise\nanatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for\ngrounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142\nnon-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the\nCT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to\nextract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented\nby expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were\nannotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.\nApproximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.\nThe training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,\nwhile the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding\nentity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and\nevaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models\nin chest CT.

In addition, unlike other\ncandidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM\nprovides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical\ndeployment and standardization in 6G.

Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of\nGaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver\ninformation symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the\ntarget's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by\nprocessing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the\nsequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the\ninformation signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of\nthe information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive\nthe corresponding Cram\\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose\npractical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we\nformulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to\nminimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.\nWhen the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting\nbeamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an\noptimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic\nsensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a\nlocally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing\nGaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for\ntarget sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior\nISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes."}

In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user\nand the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while\nsuppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS)\napplies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private\nand a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive\nclosed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage\nprobability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We\nformulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS\nunder unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we\npropose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is\ndesigned using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced\nto further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate,\nhighlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert\ncommunication."}

The scheme\nis tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional\northogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from\nunreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By\nexploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables\naccurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive\ninterference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with\nan OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves\nsignificantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density.\nExtensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the\nrobustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability\nto future mMTC deployments."}

This paper presents\nsite-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray\ntracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a\nlocation calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by\noptimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and\nmeasured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for\nline-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.\nValidation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss\nprediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT\nunderestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions\nremain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and\nprovides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment."}
