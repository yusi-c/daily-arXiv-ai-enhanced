These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the\ncompactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in\nprevious work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection\nmodel with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with\nMetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers\nare used to capture both local and global features effectively.

Buck"], "title": "Power Spectral Density Estimation via Universal Truncated Order Statistics Filtering", "comment": null, "summary": "Loud transient signals in underwater acoustic data increase the bias and\nvariance of background noise power spectral density (PSD) estimates based on\nsample mean. Recently, two PSD estimators mitigated the loud transient impact\non PSD estimates by applying order statistics filtering (OSF). The first, the\nSchwock and Abadi Welch Percentile, scales a single rank order statistic (OS)\nof consecutive periodograms. The second, the truncated linear order statistics\nfilter, is a weighted sum of OS up to a chosen rank. In order to minimize\nvariance, both OSFs must carefully choose the highest rank that still\neliminates the loud transients. However, in real-time applications in dynamic\nenvironments, loud transients occur at unpredictable rates, requiring dynamic\nadjustment of the OSF ranks to keep low bias and variance. To circumvent the\nchallenges of real-time rank selection, this paper proposes a convex sum of\nOSFs across ranks with blending weights that are sequentially adjusted to favor\nthe lowest variance OSFs over a recent time window. The performance of the\nblended sum provably approaches the performance of the best fixed rank OSF.\nSimulations and real data confirm the blended OSFs effectively filter loud\ntransients out of spectrograms without explicitly choosing a threshold rank."}

The sensor array is\noften towed behind the ship, using a long flexible cable to reduce interference\nfrom the own-ship's inherent noises. This forms a towed cable sensor-array\nsystem (TCSAS). During BOT, the tow-ship has to perform a manoeuvre to make the\ntracking system observable. Such a manoeuvre destabilises the TCSAS, thus\nmaking its exact location unknown \\emph{w.r.t.} tow-ship. However, it is very\ncrucial to know the exact location of the towed sensor-array to perform\nefficient and reliable target state estimation. The existing BOT approaches\nperform TMA during own-ship manoeuvre either by pausing the measurement\nupdation step of the estimation algorithm or assuming a fixed aft position for\nthe towed sensor-array. These assumptions lead to unreliable state estimation.\nTo address this, we propose a dynamic model for TCSAS, using a lumped mass\napproach, which will provide the location of the sensor array during the\nown-ship manoeuvre.

The dynamic of TCSAS in 3D space is obtained by solving the\nequations obtained from the moment balance condition and quasi-static\nequilibrium condition at the lumped mass points.

Although microwave sensing technologies have been increasingly\ndeveloped for underground potato detection and quality assessment in recent\nyears, no accurate model has yet been established to link the dielectric\nproperties of potatoes with their key agronomic traits. To address this gap, we\ndeveloped a model for estimating potato tubers' SG based on their dielectric\nconstant. To construct and validate the model, we conducted SG measurements and\ndielectric spectroscopy measurements in the frequency range of 0.3 GHz to 3.0\nGHz on 250 potatoes of five different types (red, russet, yellow, purple, and\nchipping potatoes, with 50 samples per type). Out of the 250 data sets, 200\ndata sets were used for model development, and 50 data sets were used for model\nvalidation. A linear regression model was used to summarize the relationship\nbetween SG and dielectric constant, where the regression coefficients are\nexpressed as fourth-order polynomial functions of frequency. Experimental\nresults on the 50 validation data sets show that the model achieves high\nestimation accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAE) less than\n\\(4.8\\times10^{-3}\\) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) less than\n0.45\\%. The study of the dielectric properties of potatoes, along with the\nderived SG estimation model, provides a foundation for the future development\nof microwave sensing technologies for agronomic trait assessment in the potato\nproduction and processing industries.

However, obtaining accurate\nchannel state information (CSI) in FAS poses challenges due to its complex\nphysical structure. Traditional methods, such as pilot-based interpolation and\ncompressive sensing, are not only computationally intensive but also lack\nadaptability. Current extrapolation techniques relying on rigid parametric\nmodels do not accommodate the dynamic environment of FAS, while data-driven\ndeep learning approaches demand extensive training and are vulnerable to noise\nand hardware imperfections. To address these challenges, this paper introduces\na novel self-supervised learning network (SSNet) designed for efficient and\nadaptive channel extrapolation in FAS. We formulate the problem of channel\nextrapolation in FAS as an image reconstruction task. Here, a limited number of\nunmasked pixels (representing the known CSI of the selected ports) are used to\nextrapolate the masked pixels (the CSI of unselected ports). SSNet capitalizes\non the intrinsic structure of FAS channels, learning generalized\nrepresentations from raw CSI data, thus reducing dependency on large labelled\ndatasets. For enhanced feature extraction and noise resilience, we propose a\nmix-of-expert (MoE) module. In this setup, multiple feedforward neural networks\n(FFNs) operate in parallel. The outputs of the MoE module are combined using a\nweighted sum, determined by a gating function that computes the weights of each\nFFN using a softmax function.
