Although numerous efforts have\nbeen made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical\nsimulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of\nDeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient\nand robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission.
