While learning-based approaches such as deep unrolling and meta-learning achieve strong empirical performance, they typically lack explicit control over descent and curvature, limiting robustness. We propose a learned Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework for inverse problems within a bilevel optimization setting. Instead of learning a full optimizer, we learn a structured curvature majorant that governs each MM step while preserving classical MM descent guarantees. The majorant is parameterized by a lightweight recurrent neural network and explicitly constrained to satisfy valid MM conditions. For cosine-similarity losses, we derive explicit curvature bounds yielding diagonal majorants. When analytic bounds are unavailable, we rely on efficient Hessian-vector product-based spectral estimation to automatically upper-bound local curvature without forming the Hessian explicitly. Experiments on EEG source imaging demonstrate improved accuracy, stability, and cross-dataset generalization over deep-unrolled and meta-learning baselines."}

Moreover, recent general-purpose approaches typically rely on predictions over multi-second intervals, discarding the morphological characteristics of vital signs. To address these challenges, we propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework that extends deep state space models, enabling fine-grained conditioning on PPG for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms. We evaluate PENGUIN using six real-world PPG datasets across three distinct vital sign reconstruction tasks (electrocardiogram reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring).

Here, we examine whether higher-order cross-frequency dynamics distinguish motor planning from execution during natural reach-to-grasp behavior. EEG was recorded in a cue-based paradigm during executed precision and power grips, enabling stage-resolved analysis of preparatory and execution-related neural activity.\n  Cross-frequency bispectral analysis was used to compute bicoherence matrices across canonical frequency band pairs, from which magnitude- and phase-based features were extracted. Classification, permutation-based feature selection, and within-subject statistical testing showed that execution is characterized by substantially stronger and more discriminative nonlinear coupling than planning, with dominant contributions from beta- and gamma-driven interactions. In contrast, decoding of precision versus power grips achieved comparable performance during planning and execution, indicating that grasp-type representations emerge during planning and persist into execution.\n  Spatial and spectral analyses further revealed that informative bispectral features reflect coordinated activity across prefrontal, central, and occipital regions. Despite substantial feature redundancy, effective dimensionality reduction preserved decoding performance. Together, these findings demonstrate that nonlinear cross-frequency coupling provides an interpretable and robust marker of motor planning and execution, extending bispectral EEG analysis to ecologically valid grasping and supporting its relevance for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetic control."}

The maneuverable jamming UAV emits artificial noise to assist the source UAV in detecting multiple ground targets while interfering with an eavesdropper. The effects of residual interference caused by imperfect successive interference cancellation on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are considered, which degrades the system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR) under transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraints, and sensing requirements, the dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming are jointly optimized. Given that secure communication and sensing fundamentally conflict in terms of resource allocation, making it difficult to achieve optimal performance for both simultaneously, we adopt a two-phase design to address this challenge. By dividing the mission into the secure communication (SC) phase and the SCS phase, the A2G-ISAC system can focus on optimizing distinct objectives separately. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm employing the trust-region successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation iteratively optimizes dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming. For the SCS phase, a weighted distance minimization problem determines the suitable dual-UAV sensing positions by a greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the highest ASR among benchmarks while maintaining robust sensing performance, and confirm the impact of the SIC residual interference on both secure communication and sensing."}

Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease."}

Numerical results corroborate the good performance of the proposed angle approximation itself, as well as the consequent RBL performance in terms of root mean square errors (RMSEs) in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SotA), while maintaining a low computational complexity"}

They have been proven to be effective in urban scenarios, especially for buildings and infrastructures 3-D reconstruction and monitoring of deformation. In urban areas, occurrence of layover leads to the presence of multiple contributions within the same image pixel from scatterers located at different heights. In the context of SAR Tomography, this problem can be addressed by considering a multiple hypothesis test to detect the presence of feasible multiple scatterers [1][2]. In the present paper, we consider this problem in the framework of the information theory and exploit the theoretical tool, developed in [3], to design a one-stage adaptive architecture for multiple hypothesis testing problems in the context of SAR Tomography. Moreover, we resort to the compressive sensing approach for the estimation of the unknown parameters under each hypothesis. This architecture has been verified on both simulated as well as real data also in comparison with suitable counterparts."}

Yet, practical signals often exhibit unknown block boundaries and isolated non-zero entries, which challenge traditional approaches. A promising method to handle such complex sparsity patterns is the difference-of-logs total variation (DoL-TV) regularized sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). However, due to the complex form of DoL-TV term, the resulting optimization problem is hard to solve. This paper develops a new optimization framework for the DoL-TV SBL cost function. By introducing an exponential reparameterization of the SBL hyperparameters, we reveal a novel structure that admits a majorization-minimization formulation and naturally extends to unknown noise variance estimation. Sparse recovery results on both synthetic data and extended source direction-of-arrival estimation demonstrate improved accuracy and runtime performance compared to benchmark methods."}

Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes."}

This design enables robust capture of essential brain dynamics for various EEG recognition tasks. We validate HFMCA on two benchmark datasets, SEED and BCIC-2A, where pretraining with HFMCA consistently outperforms competitive self-supervised baselines, achieving notable gains in classification accuracy. Across diverse EEG tasks, our method demonstrates superior cross-subject generalization under leave-one-subject-out validation, advancing state-of-the-art by 2.71\\% on SEED emotion recognition and 2.57\\% on BCIC-2A motor imagery classification."}

While prior studies suggest that sub-6 GHz channels can be exploited to predict optimal mmWave beams, existing methods depend on large deep learning (DL) models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for sub-6 GHz channel-mmWave beam mapping based on the knowledge distillation (KD) technique. We develop two compact student DL architectures based on individual and relational distillation strategies, which retain only a few hidden layers yet closely mimic the performance of large teacher DL models. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed student models achieve the teacher's beam prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency while reducing trainable parameters and computational complexity by 99%."}

However, most CC models assume fixed-size inputs, such as a constant number of antennas or channel measurements. In practical systems, antennas may fail, signals may be blocked, or antenna sets may change during handovers, making fixed-input architectures fragile. Existing radio-fingerprinting approaches address this by training separate models for each antenna configuration, but the resulting training effort scales prohibitively with the array size. We propose Adaptive Positioning (AdaPos), a CC architecture that natively handles variable numbers of channel measurements. AdaPos combines convolutional feature extraction with a transformer-based encoder using learnable antenna identifiers and self-attention to fuse arbitrary subsets of CSI inputs. Experiments on two public real-world datasets (SISO and MIMO) show that AdaPos maintains state-of-the-art accuracy under missing-antenna conditions and replaces roughly 57 configuration-specific models with a single unified model. With AdaPos and our novel training strategies, we provide resilience to both individual antenna failures and full-array outages."}

A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers."}

AI acceleration is essential for safety-critical functions such as autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), where errors cannot be tolerated, and performance-critical processing of high-bandwidth sensor data, where occasional errors are tolerable. Consequently, AI accelerators for satellites must combine robust protection against radiation-induced faults with high throughput. This paper presents Safe-NEureka, a Hybrid Modular Redundant Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator for heterogeneous RISC-V systems. It operates in two modes: a redundancy mode utilizing Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) with hardware-based recovery, and a performance mode repurposing redundant datapaths to maximize parallel throughput. Furthermore, its memory interface is protected by Error Correction Codes (ECCs), and the controller by Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). Implementation in GlobalFoundries 12nm technology shows a 96 reduction in faulty executions in redundancy mode, with a manageable 15 area overhead. In performance mode, the architecture achieves near-baseline speeds on 3x3 dense convolutions with a 5 throughput and 11 efficiency reduction, compared to 48 and 53 in redundancy mode. This flexibility ensures high overheads are limited to critical tasks, establishing Safe-NEureka as a versatile solution for space applications."}
