Specifically, we investigate a\nSTAR-RIS-assisted multi-user RSMA system and develop an intelligent\noptimization strategy that jointly designs the transmitter's active\nbeamforming, the common stream rate allocation, and the passive beamforming\nvectors for the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection regions, considering\ntransceiver hardware impairments and imperfect channel state information (CSI).\nIn addition, system robustness is ensured via a bounded channel estimation\nerror model that captures CSI imperfections and guarantees resilience against\nworst-case errors. To address the highly non-convex problem, we propose an\niterative optimization algorithm that decomposes it into two sub-problems.\nFirstly, active beamforming vectors for the common and private signals are\ndetermined by reformulating the original problem into a convex semi-definite\nprogramming (SDP) form using successive convex approximation (SCA) and\nsemi-definite relaxation (SDR). Secondly, passive beamforming vectors are\noptimized through a convex SDP reformulation by exploiting SCA and SDR\ntechniques. Moreover, when higher-rank solutions arise, Gaussian randomization\nis applied to obtain rank-one solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that\nthe proposed strategy achieves significant performance gains over benchmark\nschemes and exhibits fast convergence."}

This\narticle introduces the methodology for the orchestration of RIS with xApps\n(ORIX), bringing the RIS technology into the O-RAN ecosystem through xApp-based\ncontrol for SWF environments. ORIX features three key components: an\nO-RAN-compliant RIS service model for dynamic configuration, an RIS channel\nsimulator that supports 3GPP indoor factory models with multiple industrial\nscenarios, and practical RIS optimization strategies with finite-resolution\ncontrol. Together, these elements provide a realistic end-to-end emulation\nplatform for evaluating RIS placement, control, and performance in SWF\nenvironments prior to deployment.
