Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime\ndevices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the\ngenuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages.\nLeakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general\ninefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways\nleakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and\nexternal leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal\nleakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder\nto detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs.\nWhen leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or\nfailure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage,\nlow leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the\nbasic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system,\nand minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper. In order to fully\ndevelop this idea, experimental data collection of Hydraulic systems is\nrequired. The collected data uses pressure sensors and other signals that are\nsingle-related. Due to the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent neural networks, more complex data analysis was enabled, which the\nLSTM-based leakage detection algorithm successfully achieved, providing almost\n96% accuracy in classifying leakage types. Results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can perform real-time and online fault diagnosis for each\ncycle, reducing maintenance costs and prolonging the hydraulic system's\nlifespan."}
