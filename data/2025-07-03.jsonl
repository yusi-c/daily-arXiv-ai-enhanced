A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular\narray, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the\nconstraint of the physical length of the array."}

Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models\nrely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through\nmanual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone\nprocess. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient\nmethods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated,\ndomain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask\nlearning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class\nactivation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the\nsemi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything\n(SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient\nfeedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation\nand classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and\nimprove the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world\nclinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our\nproposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines\nby double digits in limited label settings.

This paper develops a theoretical\nframework to assess the estimation accuracy of target position and velocity in\nheterogeneous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC\nnetworks with multiple cooperative and distributed multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs). Using Fisher information analysis,\nwe first derive closed-form Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target\nlocalization in single monostatic and bistatic configurations. We then analyze\nthe benefits of BS cooperation by deriving CRLBs for joint position and\nvelocity estimation in a general setting that encompasses multiple cooperating\nmonostatic systems and multistatic networks with multiple transmitters (Txs)\nand receivers (Rxs). The influence of key system parameters, including the\nnumber of BSs, bandwidth, antenna array configuration, and network geometry, is\nsystematically examined. Numerical results highlight the performance gains\nenabled by cooperative sensing and provide insights to guide the design of\nfuture ISAC systems."}

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of\nradiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a\ncomputationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT\nanalysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays\nthe foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools\nthat could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular\nfocus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management\nin high-risk populations."}

Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based\napproaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting\nmixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as\nby reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work\nintroduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system\ndynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting.\nThis paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these\nrobust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated\nwith higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer\nsubstantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.\nSecond-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy\nwhile retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting.\nDifferent immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in three\nrepresentative test cases, including a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit,\nand a periodic three-body orbit."}

Effective algorithms in this context must be robust across a broad\nSNR range, capable of handling an unknown number of targets, and\ncomputationally efficient for real-time implementation. During the last decade,\ndifferent Machine Learning methods have emerged as promising solutions, either\nas standalone models or as complementing existing techniques. However, since\nmodels are often trained and evaluated on synthetic data from existing models,\napplying them to measurement is challenging. All the while, training directly\non measurement data is prohibitive in complex propagation scenarios as a\ngroundtruth is not available. Therefore, in this paper, we train a CNN approach\nfor target detection and estimation on synthetic data and evaluate it on\nmeasurement data from a suburban outdoor measurement. Using knowledge of the\nenvironment as well as available groundtruth positions, we study the detection\nprobability and accuracy of our approach. The results demonstrate that our\napproach works on measurement data and is suitable for joint detection and\nestimation of sensing targets in ISAC systems."}
