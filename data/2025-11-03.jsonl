The integration of cell-free massive MIMO\nwithin the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture addresses the growing\nneed for decentralized, scalable, and high-capacity networks that can support\ndifferent use cases. Precoding is a crucial step in the operation of cell-free\nmassive MIMO, where O-RUs steer their beams towards the intended users while\nmitigating interference to other users. Current precoding schemes for cell-free\nmassive MIMO are either fully centralized or fully distributed.

In this paper, we propose a distributed and scalable\nprecoding framework for cell-free massive MIMO that uses limited information\nexchange among precoding agents to mitigate interference.

The propagation path around\nthe human thigh gives information regarding leg motions that can be used for\nthe classification of activities. The variation of the transmission coefficient\nis measured between two on-body polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible\nantennas for six different leg-based activities that exhibit unique\ntime-varying signatures. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) along with\ndifferent classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), decision trees,\nnaive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), is applied for feature extraction\nand classification to evaluate the efficiency for classifying different\nactivity signals. Additional algorithms, such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and\ndeep convolutional neural network (DCNN), have also been implemented, and in\neach case, SVM with DWT outperforms the others. Simulation to evaluate a\nspecific absorption rate (SAR) is carried out as the antenna is positioned on\nthe human thigh leaving no gap. The results show that the SAR is within the\nthreshold as per the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) standard."}

It can reduce economic losses in the industry due to unexpected\nfailures. Existing fault analysis methods are either expensive or demand\nexpertise for the installation of the sensors. This article proposes a novel\nmethod for the detection of bearing faults and imbalance in induction motors\nusing an antenna as the sensor, which is noninvasive and cost-efficient.\nTime-varying S11 is measured using an omnidirectional antenna, and it is seen\nthat the spectrogram of S11 shows unique characteristics for different fault\nconditions. The experimental setup has analytically evaluated the vibration\nfrequencies due to fault and validated the characteristic fault frequency by\napplying FFT analysis on the captured S11 data. This article has evaluated the\naverage power content of the detected signals at normal and different fault\nconditions. A deep learning model is used to classify the faults based on the\nreflection coefficient ( S11). It is found that classification accuracy of\n98.2% is achieved using both magnitude and phase of S11, 96% using the\nmagnitude of S11 and 92.1% using the phase of S11. The classification accuracy\nfor different operating frequencies, antenna location, and time windows are\nalso investigated."}

Specifically, based on\nLoS/NLoS identification, an adaptive activation between the model-based and\nCC-based methods is conducted. Aiming for unsupervised learning, information\nobtained from the model-based method is utilized to train the CC model, where a\npairwise distance loss (involving a new dissimilarity metric design), a triplet\nloss (if timestamps are available), a LoS-based loss, and an optimal transport\n(OT)-based loss are jointly employed such that the global geometry can be well\npreserved. To reduce the training complexity of UNILocPro, we propose a\nlow-complexity implementation (called UNILoc), where the CC model is trained\nwith self-generated labels produced by a single pre-training OT transformation,\nwhich avoids iterative Sinkhorn updates involved in the OT-based loss\ncomputation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nunified frameworks achieve significantly improved positioning accuracy compared\nto both model-based and CC-based methods. Notably, UNILocPro with timestamps\nattains performance on par with fully-supervised fingerprinting despite\noperating without labelled training data. It is also shown that the\nlow-complexity UNILoc can substantially reduce training complexity with only\nmarginal performance degradation."}

Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon\nemissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the\nsignificance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate\nchange, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality\nforest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,\nElev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are\nimportant for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,\ncanopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy\nemerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent\ntropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02\nMg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across\nall laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in\nestimating total biomass per plot."}

Eldar", "Saikat Chatterjee"], "title": "pDANSE: Particle-based Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation from Nonlinear Measurements", "comment": "11 pages, 10 figures, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal\n  Processing", "summary": "We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation\n(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose\nunderlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred\nto as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides\nparameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free\nprocess, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of\nDANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for\nthe state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system\nrenders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics\nof the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed\nat the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a\nreparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the\nsecond-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred\nto as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential\nmeasurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive\nsequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the\nsemi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised\nlearning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system\nas a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation\nperformance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic\nnonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is\nused; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and\nCartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The\nperformance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\\`a-vis particle\nfilters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system."}

However, these advancements are accompanied by a rise\nin interference threats, which can significantly compromise the reliability and\nsafety of GNSS. Such interference problems are typically addressed through\nsignal-processing techniques that rely on physics-based mathematical models.\nUnfortunately, solutions of this nature can often fail to fully capture the\ncomplex forms of interference.
