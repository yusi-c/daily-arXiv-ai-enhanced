The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We\nbelieve that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,\nand applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the\ntranslational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs."}

The\ndesign is separated into two problems: beamforming-aware UAV placement\noptimization and transceiver design for minimum SINR maximization. A\nsignificant challenge in beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization is the\nlack of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) prior to deploying UAV\nrelays, making it difficult to derive the beamforming SINR in non-orthogonal\nmulti-user transmission. To address this issue, an approximation of the\nexpected beamforming SINR is derived using the narrow beam property of a\nmassive MIMO base station.

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet.

Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among\naccuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the\nnumber of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition\n(TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of\nsuch signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous\nhigh-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline\nreframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is\ntransformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the\ncontinuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding\nand connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to\nautomatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The\nmodes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform.\nValidation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately\ndetermines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its\nperformance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative\nanalysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a\nwider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals\nits superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design.\nThe method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully\nextracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal.

Accepted for publication at the 2024 IEEE 35th\n  International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications\n  (PIMRC)", "summary": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) design is crucial for 6G and\nharmonizes environmental data sensing with communication, emphasizing the need\nto understand and model these elements. This paper delves into dual-channel\nmodels for ISAC, employing channel extraction techniques to validate and\nenhance accuracy. Focusing on millimeter wave (mmWave) radars, it explores the\nextraction of the bistatic sensing channel from monostatic measurements and\nsubsequent communication channel estimation. The proposed methods involve\ninterference extraction, module and phase correlation analyses, chirp\nclustering, and auto-clutter reduction. A comprehensive set-up in an anechoic\nchamber with controlled scenarios evaluates the proposed techniques,\ndemonstrating successful channel extraction and validation through Root Mean\nSquare Delay Spread (RMS DS), Power Delay Profile (PDP), and Angle of Arrival\n(AoA) analysis. Comparison with Ray-Tracing (RT) simulations confirms the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, presenting an innovative stride towards\nfully integrated sensing and communication in future networks."}

Targets such as an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), a pedestrian, and\na full-scale car were measured in the frequency bands referred to in industry\nstandards as FR2 and FR3. Measurements were taken in diverse environments,\nindoors and outdoors, to ensure comprehensive scenario coverage. The\nmethodology employed in RCS extraction performs background subtraction,\nfollowed by time-domain gating to isolate the influence of the target. This\nanalysis compares the RCS values and how the points of greatest contribution\nare distributed across different bands based on the range response of the RCS.\nAnalysis of the results demonstrated how RCS values change with frequency and\ntarget shape, providing insights into the electromagnetic behaviour of these\ntargets. Key findings highlight how much scaling RCS values based on frequency\nand geometry is complex and varies among different types of materials and\nshapes. These insights are instrumental for advancing sensing systems and\nenhancing 3GPP channel models, particularly for Integrated Sensing and\nCommunications (ISAC) techniques proposed for 6G standards."}

In this paper, we propose\nDual-ImRUNet, an efficient uplink-assisted deep implicit CSI feedback framework\nincorporating two novel plug-in preprocessing modules to achieve ultra-low\nfeedback rates while maintaining high environmental robustness. First, a novel\nbi-directional correlation enhancement module is proposed to strengthen the\ncorrelation between uplink and downlink CSI eigenvector matrices. This module\nprojects highly correlated uplink and downlink channel matrices into their\nrespective eigenspaces, effectively reducing redundancy for ultra-low-rate\nfeedback. Second, an innovative input format alignment module is designed to\nmaintain consistent data distributions at both encoder and decoder sides\nwithout extra transmission overhead, thereby enhancing robustness against\nenvironmental variations. Finally, we develop an efficient transformer-based\nimplicit CSI feedback network to exploit angular-delay domain sparsity and\nbi-directional correlation for ultra-low-rate CSI compression. Simulation\nresults demonstrate successful reduction of the feedback overhead by 85%\ncompared with the state-of-the-art method and robustness against unseen\nenvironments."}

We\nintroduce a Kalman filter (KF)-based method for estimating road roughness in\nterms of the international roughness index (IRI) by fusing inertial and speed\nmeasurements, offering a cost-effective solution for pavement monitoring. The\nmethod involves system identification on a physical vehicle to estimate\nrealistic model parameters, followed by KF-based reconstruction of the\nlongitudinal road profile to compute IRI values. It explores IRI estimation\nusing vertical and lateral vibrations, the latter more common in modern\nvehicles. Validation on 230 km of real-world data shows promising results, with\nIRI estimation errors ranging from 1% to 10% of the reference values. However,\naccuracy deteriorates significantly when using only lateral vibrations,\nhighlighting their limitations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\nKF-based estimation for efficient road roughness monitoring."}
