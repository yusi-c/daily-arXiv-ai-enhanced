A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method."}

However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios. The code and database are available at: https://github.com/jwqian54/Migration-Assisted-DL."}

In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model."}

This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a series of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. An artificial intelligence (deep learning) model was used to characterize treatment-induced changes by predicting the temporal order of paired images. The model was first trained with the images from the first and the last fractions (F1-FL), then with all pairs (All-pairs). Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), compared to a radiologist's performance, and qualitative analyses - the saliency map evaluation to investigate affected anatomical regions. Input ablation experiments were performed to identify the anatomical regions altered by radiotherapy. The radiologist conducted an additional task on partial images reconstructed by saliency map regions, reporting observations as well. Quantitative image analysis was conducted to investigate the results from the model and the radiologist. Results: The F1-FL model yielded near-perfect performance (AUC of 0.99), significantly outperforming the radiologist. The All-pairs model yielded an AUC of 0.97. This performance reflects therapy-induced changes, supported by the performance correlation to fraction intervals, ablation tests and expert's interpretation. Primary regions driving the predictions were prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Conclusion: The model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over one or a few days, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations confirmed by experts. This underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance."}

The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment. In the Yellow Sea experiment, the depth estimation absolute errors by OCMS-D with a 4-second time window are less than 2.4 m.

We find statistical significance across all bundles for all metrics with one exception in volume overlap. After we run TractSeg and our model, we combine their output masks into a 60 label atlas to evaluate if TractSeg and our model combined can generate a robust, individualized atlas, and observe smoothed, continuous masks in cases that TractSeg did not produce an anatomically plausible output. With the improvement of white matter pathway segmentation masks, we can further understand neurodevelopment on a population level scale, and we can produce reliable estimates of individualized anatomy in pediatric white matter diseases and disorders."}

We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Simulations show that PR-LRTC achieves a 4 dB gain over baselines at a 10% sampling ratio. It effectively preserves sharp shadowing edges, providing a robust, physics-compliant solution for low-overhead beam management."}

Specifically, our method compresses high-level semantic representations of the video, then uses a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct frames from these semantics. To further improve compression, we characterize motion information with global camera trajectories and foreground segmentation: background motion is compactly represented by camera pose parameters while foreground dynamics by sparse segmentation masks. This allows for significantly boosts compression efficiency, enabling descent video reconstruction at extremely low bit-rates."}

Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection.

Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations."}

We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the \"domain gap\" and \"feature absence\" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.
