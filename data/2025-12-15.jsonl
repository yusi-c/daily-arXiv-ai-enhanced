However, constructing high-fidelity RMs at operational scales is difficult, since physics-based solvers are time-consuming and require precise scene models, while learning methods degrade under incomplete priors and sparse measurements, often smoothing away critical discontinuities. We present RMSup, a physics-informed super-resolution framework that functions with uniform sparse sampling and imperfect environment priors. RMSup extracts Helmholtz equation-informed boundary and singularity prompts from the measurements, fuses them with base-station side information and coarse scene descriptors as conditional inputs, and employs a boundary-aware dual-head network to reconstruct a high-fidelity RM and recover environmental contours jointly. Experimental results show the proposed RMsup achieves state-of-the-art performance both in RM construction and ISAC-related environment sensing."}

This paper investigates PA-assisted BSC for enhanced communication and covertness in the presence of a randomly distributed eavesdropper. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the uplink covert transmission rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power and antenna positions while satisfying both communication reliability and covertness constraints. An alternative optimization (AO)-based framework is proposed to solve this problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed PA-BSC effectively mitigates the double near-far problem, where energy harvesting and backscatter transmission degrade simultaneously due to distance disparities, thereby improving downlink energy harvesting and uplink data transmission while maintaining covertness performance under practical deployment scenarios."}

The IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement has accepted this research for publication, and it is currently accessible in its early access version", "summary": "The detection of underwater targets is severely affected by the non-uniform spatial characteristics of marine environmental noise. Additionally, the presence of both natural and anthropogenic acoustic sources, including shipping traffic, marine life, and geological activity, further complicates the underwater acoustic landscape. Addressing these challenges requires advanced underwater sensors and robust signal processing techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system combined with a broadband generalized sparse covariance-fitting framework for underwater target direction sensing, particularly focusing on robustness against non-uniform noise. The DAS system incorporates a newly developed spiral-sensitized optical cable, which significantly improves sensitivity compared to conventional submarine cables. This innovative design enables the system to capture acoustic signals with greater precision. Notably, the sensitivity of the spiral-wound sensitized cable is around -145.69 dB re: 1 rad / (uPa*m), as measured inside the standing-wave tube. Employing simulations, we assess the performance of the algorithm across diverse noise levels and target configurations, consistently revealing higher accuracy and reduced background noise compared to conventional beamforming techniques and other sparse techniques. In a controlled pool experiment, the correlation coefficient between waveforms acquired by the DAS system and a standard hydrophone reached 0.973, indicating high fidelity in signal capture."}

In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive--via rank analysis--the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds."}

This standard aims at providing inter-operable compressed bitstreams of features in the context of split computing, i.e., when the inference of a large computer vision neural-network (NN)-based model is split between two devices. Intermediate features can consist of multiple 3D tensors that can be reduced and entropy coded to limit the required bandwidth of such transmission. In the envisioned design for the MPEG-FCM standard, intermediate feature tensors may be reduced using Neural layers before being converted into 2D video frames that can be coded using existing video compression standards. This paper introduces an additional channel truncation and packing method which enables the system to preserve the relevant channels, depending on the statistics of the features at inference time, while preserving the computer vision task performance at the receiver. Implemented within the MPEG-FCM test model, the proposed method yields an average reduction in rate by 10.59% for a given accuracy on multiple computer vision tasks and datasets."}

The framework also provides a geometric interpretation of aliasing based on the antenna array geometry, target position, and antenna element spacing. Numerical results corroborate theoretical findings and show that the aliasing-free region enlarges with smaller antenna spacing, greater target range, lower array dimensionality, and smaller arrays. These results enable more effective design of bistatic NF imaging systems."}

Closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable secrecy rates of STAR-RIS-aided communications under both the absence and presence of eavesdroppers. Unlike most existing works, the direct source destination link is incorporated in all considered schemes, and optimal transmit power allocation is investigated for HD and FD-DF relaying. Furthermore, we provide the conditions under which STAR-RIS outperforms HD- and FD-DF relaying and quantify the minimum number of STAR-RIS elements required to achieve superior rates. The impacts of key system parameters including transmit power, number of elements, reflection-to-transmission power ratio, element-splitting factor, and deployment positions on both achievable and secrecy performance are investigated. The results reveal that STAR-RIS systems can achieve superior rates and secrecy rates compared to all benchmark schemes."}

It is particularly effective in scenarios where vision-based sensors fail to capture reliable information, such as detecting occluded objects or distinguishing between different surface materials in indoor environments. Due to the non-linear characteristics of mmWave radar signals, deep learning-based methods are well suited for extracting relevant information from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data. However, the current state of the art in IQ signal-based occluded-object and material classification still offers substantial potential for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional cross-attention fusion network that combines IQ-signal and FFT-transformed radar features obtained by distinct complex-valued convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method achieves improved performance and robustness compared to standalone complex-valued CNNs. We achieve a near-perfect material classification accuracy of 99.92% on samples collected at same sensor-to-surface distances used during training, and an improved accuracy of 67.38% on samples measured at previously unseen distances, demonstrating improved generalization ability across varying measurement conditions.

Its ability to penetrate lightweight materials such as packaging or thin walls enables non-visual sensing in industrial and automated environments and can provide robotic platforms with enhanced environmental perception when used alongside optical sensors. Recent work with MIMO mmWave radar has demonstrated its ability to penetrate cardboard packaging for occluded object classification. However, existing models leave room for improvement and warrant a more thorough evaluation across different sensing frequencies. In this paper, we propose ACCOR, an attention-enhanced complex-valued contrastive learning approach for radar, enabling robust occluded object classification. We process complex-valued IQ radar signals using a complex-valued CNN backbone, followed by a multi-head attention layer and a hybrid loss. Our proposed loss combines a weighted cross-entropy term with a supervised contrastive term. We further extend an existing 64 GHz dataset with a 67 GHz subset of the occluded objects and evaluate our model using both center frequencies. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms prior radar-specific models and image classification models with adapted input, achieving classification accuracies of 96.60% at 64 GHz and 93.59% at 67 GHz for ten different objects.
