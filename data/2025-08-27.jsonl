This study presents the first cross cancer\nevaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated\nwhole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)\nand 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public\nAutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain\nperformance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.\nTarget only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For\nthe tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain\naccuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC\nless than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model\ngeneralized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung\ncohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).\nThe combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung\n(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and\nimproving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that\ndataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi\ncancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust\ngeneralization.
