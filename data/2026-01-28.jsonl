It provides large-scale antenna reconfiguration, establishes stable line-of-sight links, mitigates signal blockage, and exploits near-field advantages through its distinctive architecture. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in PASS. The fundamental principles of PASS are first discussed, including its hardware architecture, circuit and physical models, and signal models. Several emerging PASS designs, such as segmented PASS (S-PASS), center-fed PASS (C-PASS), and multi-mode PASS (M-PASS), are subsequently introduced, and their design features are discussed. In addition, the properties and promising applications of PASS for wireless sensing are reviewed. On this basis, recent progress in the performance analysis of PASS for both communications and sensing is surveyed, and the performance gains achieved by PASS are highlighted. Existing research contributions in optimization and machine learning are also summarized, with the practical challenges of beamforming and resource allocation being identified in relation to the unique transmission structure and propagation characteristics of PASS. Finally, several variants of PASS are presented, and key implementation challenges that remain open for future study are discussed."}

While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication."}

While prior work has primarily focused on discrete-valued sequences, we extend the results of Bu et al. (TSP 2019) to continuous-valued sequences and develop a distribution-free test based on the MMD metric. Our framework handles both known and unknown numbers of outliers. In the unknown-count case, we bound the detection performance and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of three types of error probabilities.

Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively resolves the OFDM coupling issue and achieves significant secrecy rate gains, outperforming single-IRS and distributed multi-IRS benchmarks by 32.0% and 22.3%, respectively."}

This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware status updates in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, where each vehicle's status is represented by multiple interdependent packets. To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE).

These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation.

The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization."}

In centralized operation, channel estimation and data decoding are performed at the central processing unit (CPU), whereas in distributed operation, channel estimation occurs at the APs and data detection at the CPU.

Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity.

Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions.

Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.\n  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations.\n  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.\n  Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions."}

Existing rate control schemes typically leverage frame content to capture distortion interactions, overlooking inter-frame rate dependencies arising from shifts in per-frame coding parameters.

To address this, we propose a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based rate control framework that formulates the task as a frame-by-frame sequential decision process. At each frame, an RL agent observes a spatiotemporal state and selects coding parameters to optimize a long-term reward that reflects rate-distortion (R-D) performance and bitrate adherence. Unlike prior methods, our approach jointly determines bitrate allocation and coding parameters in a single step, independent of group of pictures (GOP) structure. Extensive experiments across diverse NVC architectures show that our method reduces the average relative bitrate error to 1.20% and achieves up to 13.45% bitrate savings at typical GOP sizes, outperforming existing approaches. In addition, our framework demonstrates improved robustness to content variation and bandwidth fluctuations with lower coding overhead, making it highly suitable for practical deployment."}

Building on a physics-based $S$-matrix model established in prior work, we adopt a statistical characterization of random phase and amplitude distortions caused by multiple scattering in rain. Based on this model, we develop a measurement framework for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) that explicitly incorporates such distortions. To mitigate their impact, we exploit the Hermitian Toeplitz (HT) structure of the covariance matrix to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. We then apply a generalized least squares (GLS) approach for calibration. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively suppresses rain-induced distortions, improves DoA estimation accuracy, and enhances radar sensing performance in challenging weather conditions."}

Building upon the concept of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output in terrestrial networks, we propose a coordinated transmission scheme where multiple satellites jointly transmit spatially multiplexed data streams to each user. Using a new approximate achievable rate expression, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem under per-satellite and per-antenna power constraints and use the classical equivalence between sum rate maximization and mean square error minimization to optimize the satellites' precoding matrices using statistical channel state information. We numerically examine the performance of the proposed scheme in different settings and validate its effectiveness by comparing it against traditional precoding designs."}

We cast the per-block channel as a three-parameter model consisting of the channel amplitude, channel phase, and angle-of-arrival at the ITS. We exploit temporal correlation by updating the priors using the estimates from the previous block. Using only two pilots per coherence block alongside a targeted beam alignment strategy, the proposed method achieves precise channel tracking and attains spectral efficiency close to that achievable under perfect channel knowledge."}

However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols."}

We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting."}

Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and three real \\textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity."}
