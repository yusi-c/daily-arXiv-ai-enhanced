In this paper,\nwe introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)\noptimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to\nshape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and\nestimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the\nfundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages\nin wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable\nantenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show\nthe superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\nFinally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding\ninsights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna\ntechnologies."}

However, existing studies ignore the physical\nconstraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance\nenhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and\nadjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over\nconventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the\nlarge-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed."}
