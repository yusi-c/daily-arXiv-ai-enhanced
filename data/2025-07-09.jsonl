To overcome the\ninherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable\nregistration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a\ncontrolled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and\nalignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability\non two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that\nintegrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,\noutperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.\nNotably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low\nand the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned."}

Existing\ndeep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,\noverlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a\npowerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new\nopportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce\nLangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages\nVLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).\nLangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a\nLanguage-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT\nimages into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our\nfindings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to\nadvance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba."}
