This makes\noptimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders\ncrucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor\nreceivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as\nwell as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed\nheuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power\ninefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC\nframework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in\ngeneral multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic\nSIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing\nan SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally\nrequiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided\nsorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex\noptimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary\nsearch. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent\nhigh-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the\nbest of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the\nPareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the\ndoor to scalable interference management in cell-free networks."}

Since the legacy wireless systems\nwere designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless\ninterference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the\nexisting legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by\ncritical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent\nneed to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.\nFor many applications, legacy users are located within\ngeographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating\ninterference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these\ngeographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on\ngeographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based\nsolution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,\nwe aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users.

Typically, the image based approaches are not suitable\nduring interventions, particularly for minimally invasive surgery. To this end,\nwe present a miniaturized fiber scanning endoscope for fast and localized\nelastography. Moreover, we propose a deep learning based signal processing\npipeline to account for the intricate data and the need for real-time\nestimates. Our elasticity estimation approach is based on imaging complex and\ndiffuse wave fields that encompass multiple wave frequencies and propagate in\nvarious directions. We optimize the probe design to enable different scan\npatterns. To maximize temporal sampling while maintaining three-dimensional\ninformation we define a scan pattern in a conical shape with a temporal\nfrequency of 5.05 kHz. To efficiently process the image sequences of complex\nwave fields we consider a spatio-temporal deep learning network. We train the\nnetwork in an end-to-end fashion on measurements from phantoms representing\nmultiple elasticities. The network is used to obtain localized and robust\nelasticity estimates, allowing to create elasticity maps in real-time. For 2D\nscanning, our approach results in a mean absolute error of 6.31+-5.76 kPa\ncompared to 11.33+-12.78 kPa for conventional phase tracking. For scanning\nwithout estimating the wave direction, the novel 3D method reduces the error to\n4.48+-3.63 kPa compared to 19.75+-21.82 kPa for the conventional 2D method.\nFinally, we demonstrate feasibility of elasticity estimates in ex-vivo porcine\ntissue."}

We\ninvestigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on\nImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via\nself-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.\n1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate\nclass balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic\ndata.

First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we\nderive its corresponding baseband representation.
