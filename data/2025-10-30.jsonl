Recent advancements in deep\nlearning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.\nHowever, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that\nnecessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered\ncomputing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless\nnetworks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for\ndistributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to\nperform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this\ninvestigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this\ndistributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying\nmodulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective\nof the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncentralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate\nof 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around\n41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods\nexhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,\nthe initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while\nsubstantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized\nmodel. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature\nmap, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies\na substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.\nThese findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly\nenhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of\nbandwidth-limited wireless networks."}

In\nthe complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ\nparticle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the\nhidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle\nfiltering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of\nthe system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based\noptimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle\nfilters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several\nrecently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering\ndifferentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such\ndifferentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular\nPyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible\nto a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison\nbetween them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several\nexisting studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several\ncommon challenges with state space modelling."}

Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because\nthey tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that\nGrassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the\nunintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM\nmodulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results\nsuggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian\nsignaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and\nperformance."}

This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the\nnon-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse\nsolvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a\nsingle reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple\nplausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data,\nthereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the\nnon-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into\nthe reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space\nof candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent\nwith the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest\nscattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered\nfields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled\ndatasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative\nlabeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of\nscattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high\nquality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with\nexcellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of\nhybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust,\ndata-driven microwave imaging."}
