In the latter,\ncurrent assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high\nheterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the\ngold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck\nfor specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated\ndatasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study\nintroduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)\ncoupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic\nimage-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses\ndata scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,\nhigh-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse\nanatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand\ntraining datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in\nlaryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of\nonly 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%\nwhen the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.\nAdditionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5\nexpert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence\nin distinguishing synthetic from real images.
