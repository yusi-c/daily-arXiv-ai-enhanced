To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user\ncommunications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely\nwaveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching\n(WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing\nand pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast\ncommunication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special\ncase. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission\nstructure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve\nthe highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and\nfractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is\ninvoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented\nLagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling\nconstraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting\naugmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is\nextended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a\nlow-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS\nstructure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the\nlarge-scale path loss at each user.

Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless\nnetworks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability\nand adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate\nthe Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication\ntechnology for transmission.

In this work, we present a rule-based\napproach for subpixel-accurate key-point extraction from MRI, adapted from\nprior CT-based methods. Our approach incorporates robust image alignment and\nvertebra-specific orientation estimation to generate anatomically meaningful\nlandmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points, like\nmuscle and ligament insertions in biomechanical models. These models enable the\nsimulation of spinal mechanics considering the subject's individual anatomy,\nand thus support the development of tailored approaches in clinical diagnostics\nand treatment planning. By leveraging MR imaging, our method is radiation-free\nand well-suited for large-scale studies and use in underrepresented\npopulations. This work contributes to the digital twin ecosystem by bridging\nthe gap between precise medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation,\nand aligns with key themes in personalized modeling for healthcare."}
