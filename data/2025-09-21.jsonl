Paper submitted to IEEE Internet of Things\n  Journal, paper ID IoT-55019-2025", "summary": "Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA), which combines the advantages\nof pure NOMA and conventional OMA organically, has emerged as a highly\npromising multiple access technology for future wireless networks. Recent\nstudies have proposed various H-NOMA systems by employing different successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) methods for the NOMA transmission phase.\nHowever, existing analyses typically assume a fixed channel gain order between\npaired users, despite the fact that channel coefficients follow random\ndistribution, leading to their magnitude relationships inherently stochastic\nand time varying. This paper analyzes the performance of three H-NOMA schemes\nunder stochastic channel gain ordering: a) fixed order SIC (FSIC) aided H-NOMA\nscheme; b) hybrid SIC with non-power adaptation (HSIC-NPA) aided H-NOMA scheme;\nc) hybrid SIC with power adaptation (HSIC-PA) aided H-NOMA scheme. Theoretical\nanalysis derives closed-form expressions for the probability that H-NOMA\nschemes underperform conventional OMA. Asymptotic results in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are also developed. Simulation results\nvalidate our analysis and demonstrate the performance of H-NOMA schemes across\ndifferent SNR scenarios, providing a theoretical foundation for the deployment\nof H-NOMA in next-generation wireless systems."}

This is achieved by designing a sampling\noperator by an optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex, as the\nbest possible recovery imposes a rank constraint. An existing method for\nvertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices\nbut cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To\naddress these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that\nhandles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on\nspecific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We\ntransformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC)\noptimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex\nselection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general\ndouble-proximal gradient DC algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is\ndemonstrated through experiments on various graph signal models, including\nreal-world data, showing superior performance in the recovery accuracy by\ncomparing to existing methods."}

While fully\nRL-based schemes offer adaptability to topology dynamics, they often suffer\nfrom high complexity, long convergence times, and unstable performance under\nheavy traffic. In contrast, the proposed framework exploits deterministic table\nlookups under nominal conditions and selectively activates the DQL agent only\nwhen links become unavailable or congested. Simulation results in large-scale\nNGSO networks show that the hybrid approach consistently achieves higher packet\ndelivery ratio, lower end-to-end delay, shorter average hop count, and improved\nthroughput compared to a pure RL baseline. These findings highlight the\neffectiveness of hybrid routing as a scalable and resilient solution for\ndelay-sensitive satellite broadband services"}

Traditional direct computation requires\n$K{\\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$,\nwhile alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require\nstoring entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed\nmethod eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost\nto only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time\nimplementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be\nefficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems."}

Recent findings indicate that learning a unified\nthree-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs)\nderived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of\nWi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI\nsignals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive\nnoise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing\npreprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections\nused in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for\nmulti-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas\nbased on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler\nvelocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand\ngesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided\nWi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,\npaving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments."}

However, as the number of antennas at the\naccess points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the\nnear-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional\nassumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this\nchallenge, this paper establishes a covariance-based formulation that can\neffectively capture the statistical property of hybrid near-far field channels.\nBased on this formulation, we theoretically reveal that increasing the\nproportion of near-field channels enhances the detection performance.\nFurthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm, where each AP performs local\nactivity detection and only exchanges the detection results to the central\nprocessing unit, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and\nthe communication overhead. Not only with convergence guarantee, the proposed\nalgorithm is unified in the sense that it can handle single-cell or cell-free\nsystems with either near-field or far-field devices as special cases.\nSimulation results validate the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods."}
