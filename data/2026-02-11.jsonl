This paper introduces an operator-based formulation of information theory for imaging. The approach models the imaging chain as a composition of bounded operators acting on functions, and characterises information redistribution using the spectral properties of these operators. Three measures are developed. Operator entropy quantifies how an operator distributes energy across its singular spectrum. Operator information capacity describes the number of modes that remain recoverable above a noise-dependent threshold. An irreversibility index measures the information lost through suppression or elimination of modes and captures the accumulation of information loss under operator composition. The framework applies to linear, nonlinear, and stochastic operators and does not depend on the specific imaging modality. Analytical examples show how attenuation, blur, and sampling affect entropy, capacity, and irreversibility in different ways. The results provide a general structure for analysing the physical limits of imaging and form the basis for subsequent work on information geometry, spatiotemporal budgets, nonlinear channels, and reconstruction algorithms."}

Instead of transmitting pixel level video chunks, PromptPream sends compact semantic prompts that are decoded into high quality frames using generative models such as Stable Diffusion. We propose three core techniques to enable this paradigm: (1) a gradient based prompt inversion method that compresses frames into small sets of compact token embeddings; (2) a computation aware scheduling strategy that jointly optimizes network and compute resource usage; and (3) a scalable searching algorithm that addresses the enlarged scheduling space introduced by scheduler. Evaluations show that PromptStream reduces both stalls and bandwidth waste by over 31%, and improves Quality of Experience (QoE) by 45%, compared to traditional strategies."}

However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon: even when the actual encoded bitrate does not fully utilize the available bandwidth, stalling events remain frequent. This insufficient bandwidth utilization arises from the intrinsic temporal variations of real-time video encoding, which cause conventional packet-level congestion control algorithms to misestimate available bandwidth. When a high-bitrate frame is suddenly produced, sending at the wrong rate can either trigger packet loss or increase queueing delay, resulting in playback stalls.\n  To address these issues, we present Camel, a novel frame-level congestion control algorithm (CCA) tailored for LLS. Our insight is to use frame-level network feedback to capture the true network capacity, immune to the irregular sending pattern caused by encoding. Camel comprises three key modules: the Bandwidth and Delay Estimator and the Congestion Detector, which jointly determine the average sending rate, and the Bursting Length Controller, which governs the emission pattern to prevent packet loss.\n  We evaluate Camel on both large-scale real-world deployments and controlled simulations. In the real-world platform with 250M users and 2B sessions across 150+ countries, Camel achieves up to a 70.8% increase in 1080P resolution ratio, a 14.4% increase in media bitrate, and up to a 14.1% reduction in stalling ratio. In simulations under undershooting, shallow buffers, and network jitter, Camel outperforms existing congestion control algorithms, with up to 19.8% higher bitrate, 93.0% lower stalling ratio, and 23.9% improvement in bandwidth estimation accuracy."}

This paper presents a massive-sized CSI dataset, WiLoc (Wi-Fi Localization), and makes it publicly available. WiLoc is obtained by a series of precision measurement campaigns that span three months, and it is massive in all the above-mentioned three dimensions: > 12 million UE locations, > 3,000 APs, covering 16 buildings for indoor localization, and > 30 streets for outdoor use.

To address these challenges, digitial-twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to offer virtual replicas of real-world systems, facilitating prediction for resource management. In this work, we study a time-window-based DT-aided DSS framework for ISTNs, enabling joint long-term and short-term resource decisions to reduce system congestion.

Imperfect channel state information (CSI) is considered for all links, where robustness is ensured by modeling channel estimation errors within a bounded uncertainty region, guaranteeing worst-case performance reliability. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using an alternating optimization framework. The precoding subproblem is reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via linear matrix inequalities derived using the S-procedure. The RIS reflection matrix is optimized using successive convex approximation (SCA), yielding an equivalent SDP formulation. The MA position optimization is addressed through SCA combined with block coordinate descent (BCD) method.

In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas.

Timely and accurate fault detection is essential to prevent unexpected failures and reduce maintenance costs. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual feature extraction and shallow classifiers, which may be inadequate for capturing the complex patterns embedded in raw vibration signals. In this study, a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for automated bearing fault diagnosis using raw time-domain vibration data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The model is trained and evaluated on two established benchmark datasets: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. The CWRU data were segmented based on four distinct motor load conditions (0 HP to 3 HP), with each load scenario trained and tested independently to ensure strict separation and prevent data leakage. The CNN achieved high average test accuracies of 99.14%, 98.85%, 97.42%, and 95.14% for 0 HP, 1 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP, respectively. On the PU dataset, known for its naturally induced faults and greater operational variability the model achieved a robust average testing accuracy of 95.63%. These results affirm the model ability to generalize across datasets and varying operating conditions. Further improvements were observed through hyperparameter tuning, particularly window length and training epochs, underscoring the importance of tailored configurations for specific datasets and load conditions. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of 1D CNNs for real-time, data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, offering a reliable foundation for condition monitoring in industrial applications."}

We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS. Simulations validate the theory and show that the proposed unsupervised MAF-based NP detector achieves performance comparable to its supervised counterpart."}

The proposed architecture offers the advantage of cross-coupled feedback to simultaneously generate two voltage domain signals with available swings equal to the nominal supply and its double, which operate up to 12.4 GHz. A prototype HVLS circuit, along with impedance matching and a driver to enable high-speed off-chip testing, was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI process technology. The prototype consumes a total die area, including the interface circuitry, of 477 x 462 um^2, while the active area of the level-shifter is 2 x 3.26 um^2. The average power consumption of the circuit is measured to be 4.43 uW per cycle, and the jitter is less than 150 fs-rms."}

First, we formalize the conceptual and mathematical foundations of robustness, highlighting the interpretations and relations across robust statistics, optimization, and machine learning. Key techniques, such as robust estimation and testing, distributionally robust optimization, and regularized and adversary training, are investigated. Together, the costs of robustness in system design, for example, the compromised nominal performances and the extra computational burdens, are discussed. Second, we review recent robust signal processing solutions for WSC that address model mismatch, data scarcity, adversarial perturbation, and distributional shift. Specific applications include robust ranging-based localization, modality sensing, channel estimation, receive combining, waveform design, and federated learning. Through this effort, we aim to introduce the classical developments and recent advances in robustness theory to the general signal processing community, exemplifying how robust statistical, optimization, and machine learning approaches can address the uncertainties inherent in WSC systems."}

The method is blind in the way that the Base Station (BS) only requires a training sequence containing unknown data symbols obtained from the user without further knowledge on the channel, modulation, coding or even noise power. We evaluate the algorithm under the assumption of gaussian transmit signals using the non-rigorous replica method. To facilitate the computations the existence of an Operator Valued Free Fourier Transform is postulated, which is verified by Monte Carlo simulation. The replica computations are conducted in the large but finite system by applying saddle-point integration with inverse temperature $β$ as the large parameter. The classifier accuracy is estimated by gaussian approximation through moment-matching."}

These include land mobile communications, various Internet of Things (IoT) networks, machine-type communications (MTC), and various radar and satellite-based systems for navigation and sensing, as well as the emerging regime of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). A wide array of kinematic profiles is investigated, ranging from uniform motion and constant acceleration to more complex general motion. Consequently, the multi-faceted factors influencing the Doppler shift are addressed in detail, encompassing classical kinematics, special and general relativity, atmospheric dynamics, and the properties of the propagation medium. This work is intended to establish a definitive theoretical foundation for both the general enthusiast and the specialized researcher seeking to master the complexities of signal frequency shifts in modern wireless sensing and communications systems."}

To overcome these obstacles, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, is a promising candidate. We propose a novel unified joint multi-objective framework where UAVs and HAPS-RIS are fully integrated to extend coverage and enhance network performance. This joint multi-objective design maximizes the number of users served by the HAPS-RIS, minimizes the number of UAVs deployed and minimizes the total average UAV path loss subject to quality-of-service (QoS) and resource constraints. We propose a novel low-complexity solution strategy by proving the equivalence between minimizing the total average UAV path loss upper bound and k-means clustering, deriving a practical closed-form RIS phase-shift design, and introducing a mapping technique that collapses the combinatorial assignments into a zone radius and a bandwidth-portioning factor. Then, we propose a dynamic Pareto optimization technique to solve the transformed optimization problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adapts seamlessly across operating regimes. A HAPS-RIS-only setup achieves full coverage at low data rates, but UAV assistance becomes indispensable as rate demands increase. By tuning a single bandwidth portioning factor, the model recovers UAV-only, HAPS-RIS-only and equal bandwidth portioning baselines within one formulation and consistently surpasses them across diverse rate requirements. The simulations also quantify a tangible trade-off between RIS scale and UAV deployment, enabling designers to trade increased RIS elements for fewer UAVs as service demands evolve."}

RISs, thanks to their intelligent design, can reshape the wireless channel to provide favorable propagation conditions for information transfer. In this work, we experimentally investigate the potential of RISs to enhance the effective rank of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, thereby improving spatial multiplexing capabilities. In our experiment, commodity WiFi transceivers are used, representing a practical MIMO system. In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$. These results provide the first experimental evidence of RIS-driven rank manipulation with off-the-shelf WiFi hardware, offering practical insights into RIS deployment for spatial multiplexing gains."}
