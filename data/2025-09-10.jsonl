DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal\nsolutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including\nwaveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data\ndemodulation, and interference mitigation.

In\nparticular, in order to cope with the dynamics of time-varying mmWave channels,\nthe detection of communication symbols and the execution of an over-the-air\ncomputing (AirComp) operation are performed in parallel with channel tracking,\nas opposed to existing state-of-the-art (SotA) on ICC where perfect knowledge\nof the channel at all time instances is typically assumed. For clarity of\nexposition, we consider a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) uplink scenario\nwhere multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE) transmit to a base station\n(BS) equipped with multiple antennas, such that each UE, or edge device (ED),\nprecodes its own transmit signal, while the BS, or access points (APs), also\nperforms receive beamforming. The proposed transceiver framework then estimates\nchannel state information (CSI) and data symbols in parallel, using a bilinear\nGaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) algorithm for joint channel and data\ndetection (JCDE), aided by a channel prediction (CP) algorithm executed before\neach estimation window at the BS. The AirComp operation is then executed by\nmeans of an optimal combination of the residual signal. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in performing ICC in\nchallenging time-varying mmWave channels, with minimal degradation to both\ncommunication and computing performance."}

Based on the\npreliminary positioning of the network nodes, the framework prescribes a\nworkflow and the related toolset for determining the optimal network topology\nfocusing on the weights, the operation of the transceivers, and the overall\nradiated power. The optimal network configuration is simulated by using\ncomputational electromagnetics strategies in order to assess the\nelectromagnetic environment induced by the sensor network itself.

Unlike\nconventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust\nantenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively\nmitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense\nLEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna\npositions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during\nthe whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an\noptimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of\nthe ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and\ntime-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve\nthe resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual\ntransformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective\nfunction into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block\ncoordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV\nand AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nproposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the\nachievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing\nan efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO\nsatellite communication networks."}

Specifically, a Baud-spaced digital receiver\narchitecture is investigated that combines a constant modulus algorithm (CMA)\nequalizer with a blind timing error detector (TED), enabling robust symbol\ntiming synchronization without decision-directed (DD) feedback or pilot\nsymbols. The proposed TED leverages the CMA filter coefficients to estimate\ntiming errors, which are then used to drive a Farrow interpolator operating at\ntwice the symbol rate. The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz\nwireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show\nthat the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as\nGardner and blind implementations of Mueller \\& M\\\"uller, in terms of bit error\nrate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI)\nsuppression.
