While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \\emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs."}

However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems."}

We first model the problem of maximizing the sensing performance of multiple targets while satisfying the communication performance requirements of multiple users, where both the targets and users are UAVs. For mitigating in-waveguide attenuation and improving sensing performance, the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching antenna (SWAN) system is adopted. Furthermore, an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm for SWAN-based ISAC (SWISAC-AO) is developed, where the optimal structure of the transmit beamforming solution is derived. A graph neural network (GNN), termed SWISAC-GNN, is then proposed to jointly learn PA positions and transmit beamforming, with its alternative update procedure inspired by the SWISAC-AO algorithm. Numerical results show that the GNN achieves sensing performance comparable to or better than the AO algorithm while better satisfying communication requirements.

In this Review, we summarize recent advances in applying AMC to massive MIMO, including DFT/IDFT computation for OFDM modulation and demodulation using MVM circuits; MIMO detection and precoding using MVM-based iterative algorithms; and rapid one-step solutions enabled by matrix inversion (INV) and generalized inverse (GINV) circuits.

Building on this, we propose enhancing Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli's gradient-based inverse solvers by fine-tuning the denoiser within the iterative solving process itself. Training the denoiser end-to-end across the solver framework and simultaneously across multiple tasks yields a single, versatile denoiser optimised for inverse problems. We demonstrate that even a simple baseline model fine-tuned this way achieves an average PSNR improvement of +1.34 dB across six diverse inverse problems while reducing the required iterations. Furthermore, we analyse the fine-tuned denoiser's properties, finding that its optimisation objective implicitly shifts from minimising standard denoising error (MMSE) towards approximating an ideal prior gradient specifically tailored for guiding inverse recovery."}

Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness.

This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue, but existing contrastive paradigms rely on data augmentations that conflict with the physical semantics of radio signals and require large-batch training, making them poorly suited for CSI. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CIG-MAE -- a Cross-modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder -- that reconstructs both the amplitude and phase of CSI using a symmetric dual-stream architecture with a high masking ratio. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples.

This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $α$-$μ$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions.

As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths.

Recently, it is established by Mahdavifar, Rajamäki, and Pal that array geometry of sparse arrays has fundamental connections with the design of subspace codes in coding theory. This was then utilized to design efficient \\textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \\textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas."}
