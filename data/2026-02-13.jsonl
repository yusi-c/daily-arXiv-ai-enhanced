Existing methods often overlook position relations in pulse sequences, limiting their ability to capture semantic dependencies over time. We propose RadarPos, a position-aware self-supervised framework that leverages pulse-level temporal dynamics without complex augmentations or masking, providing improved position relation modeling over contrastive learning or masked reconstruction. Using this framework, we evaluate cross-mode radar signal recognition under the long-tailed setting to assess adaptability and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced discriminability and robustness, highlighting practical applicability in real-world electromagnetic environments."}

High-contrast settings, such as subsurface models with salt bodies, exhibit strong scattering and phase sensitivity that challenge existing neural operators. We propose a hybrid architecture that decomposes the scattering operator into two separate contributions: a smooth background propagation and a high-contrast scattering correction. The smooth component is learned with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which produces globally coupled feature tokens encoding background wave propagation; these tokens are then passed to a vision transformer, where attention is used to model the high-contrast scattering correction dominated by strong, spatial interactions. Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, the hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling."}

Diffusion-based generative priors have recently shown promise, but typically rely on computationally intensive iterative sampling or per-instance optimization. Amortized variational inference frameworks address this inefficiency by learning a direct mapping from measurements to posteriors, enabling fast posterior sampling without requiring the optimization of a new posterior for every new set of measurements. However, they still struggle to reconstruct fine details and complex textures. To address this, we extend the amortized framework by injecting spatially adaptive perturbations to measurements during training, guided by uncertainty estimates, to emphasize learning in the most uncertain regions. Experiments on deblurring and super-resolution demonstrate that our method achieves superior or competitive performance to previous diffusion-based approaches, delivering more realistic reconstructions without the computational cost of iterative refinement."}

A statistical shape model of the aorta is coupled with differentiable volumetric mesh optimization to obtain personalized aortic meshes.\n  Methods: The statistical shape model was constructed from retrospective data and optimized 2D slice placements along the aortic arch were identified. Cine 2D MRI slices were then acquired in 30 subjects (19 volunteers, 11 aortic stenosis patients). After manual segmentation, time-resolved aortic models were generated via differentiable volumetric mesh optimization to derive vessel shape features, centerline parameters, and radial wall strain. In 10 subjects, additional 4D flow MRI was acquired to compare peak-systolic shapes.\n  Results: Anatomically accurate aortic geometries were obtained from as few as six cine 2D MRI slices, achieving a mean +/- standard deviation Dice score of (89.9 +/- 1.6) %, Intersection over Union of (81.7 +/- 2.7) %, Hausdorff distance of (7.3 +/- 3.3) mm, and Chamfer distance of (3.7 +/- 0.6) mm relative to 4D flow MRI. The mean absolute radius error was (0.8 +/- 0.6) mm. Significant age-related differences were observed for all shape features, including radial strain, which decreased progressively ((11.00 +/- 3.11) x 10-2 vs. (3.74 +/- 1.25) x 10-2 vs. (2.89 +/- 0.87) x 10-2 for young, mid-age, and elderly groups).\n  Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient extraction of time-resolved 3D aortic meshes from limited sets of standard cine 2D MRI acquisitions, suitable for computational shape and strain analysis."}

However, the radar detection performance is limited to spotting uncooperative targets at specular angles. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) involving metasurfaces with tunable unit cells have been researched for enhancing radar coverage around corners by directing beams towards non-specular angles. This article examines how practical considerations regarding the phase tuning of unit cells impact the RIS performance. Specifically, we examine the radar cross-section (RCS) obtained from two RIS configurations: In the first, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a theoretical analog phase shift to realize idealized one-beam patterns at the desired angles. In the second configuration, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a low-complexity, one-bit quantized element phase shift, which results in dual symmetric beams. The RIS configurations are then benchmarked with a metal plate of similar dimensions in both simulations and measurements."}

By jointly optimizing multiple full-reference (FR) objectives with adaptive task weighting, our approach learns shared representations that transfer effectively to NR-VQA.

However, to date, limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains. To address this challenge, we propose the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for NR-PCQA, which introduces a two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment paradigm to address domain shifts. At the coarse-grained stage, a discrepancy-aware coarse-grained alignment method is designed to capture relative quality relationships between cross-domain samples through a novel quality-discrepancy-aware hybrid loss, circumventing the challenges of direct absolute feature alignment. At the fine-grained stage, a perception fusion fine-grained alignment approach with symmetric feature fusion is developed to identify domain-invariant features, while a conditional discriminator selectively enhances the transfer of quality-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPDA effectively enhances the performance of NR-PCQA methods in cross-domain scenarios, validating its practical applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/yokeno1/UPDA-main."}

The access points (APs) in each cluster serve mobile user equipments (UEs) by employing RSMA. The UEs employ successive interference cancellation to decode their data. This work emphasizes the role of downlink (DL) pilots in realizing RSMA benefits in practical CF systems with spatially-correlated Rician channels which observe random phase shifts, pilot contamination, and channel aging due to UE mobility. We numerically show that DL pilots are required for RSMA in user-centric CF mMIMO systems with channel aging to outperform spatial division multiple access. We show that the degraded channel quality due to higher UE velocity and longer resource block lengths significantly reduces the RSMA SE. Increasing the number of clusters can compensate for the SE loss."}

However, most assume perfect environment information, which is unrealistic in practice due to sensor limitations, mapping errors, and temporal changes. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained with task-specific perturbations of geometry, materials, and Tx positions can implicitly compensate for prediction errors caused by inaccurate environment inputs. When tested with noisy inputs on synthetic indoor scenarios, models trained with perturbed environment data reduce error by up to 25\\% compared to models trained on clean data. We verify our approach on real-world measurements, achieving 2.1 dB RMSE with noisy input data and 1.3 dB with complete information, compared to 2.3-3.1 dB for classical methods such as ray-tracing and radial basis function interpolation. Additionally, we compare different ways of encoding environment information at varying levels of detail and we find that, in the considered single-room indoor scenarios, binary occupancy encoding performs at least as well as detailed material property information, simplifying practical deployment."}

Flanagan"], "title": "Exploiting Structural Flexibility in SIM-Enabled Communications: From Adaptive Inter-Layer Spacing to Fully Morphable Layers", "comment": "Submitted to IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as a promising metasurface-based physical-layer paradigm for wireless communications, enabling wave-domain signal processing through multiple cascaded metasurface layers. However, conventional SIM designs rely on rigid planar layers with fixed interlayer spacing, which constrain the propagation geometry and can lead to performance saturation as the number of layers increases. This paper investigates the potential of introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems. Specifically, we consider two flexible SIM architectures: distance-adaptive SIM (DSIM), where interlayer distances are optimized, and stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM), where each metasurface layer is fully morphable. We jointly design the meta-atom positions and responses together with the transmit beamformer to maximize the system sum rate under per-user rate, quantization, morphing, and interlayer distance constraints. An alternating optimization framework combining gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation is developed to address the resulting non-convex problems. Perturbation analysis reveals that the flexibility gains of both DSIM and SFIM scale approximately linearly with the morphing range, with SFIM exhibiting a faster growth rate. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs."}

However, currently employed linear precoding techniques, such as MMSE, significantly limit the achievable spectral efficiency. To meet practical error-rate targets, existing linear methods require an excessively high number of access point antennas relative to the number of supported users, leading to disproportionate increases in power consumption.Efficient non-linear processing frameworks for uplink MIMO transmissions, such as NL-COMM, have been proposed. However, downlink non-linear precoding methods, such as Vector Perturbation (VP), remain impractical for real-world deployment due to their exponentially increasing computational complexity with the number of supported streams. This work presents ViPer NL-COMM, the first practical algorithmic and implementation framework for VP-based precoding. ViPer NL-COMM extends the core principles of NL-COMM to the precoding problem, enabling scalable parallelization and real-time computational performance while maintaining the substantial spectral-efficiency benefits of VP precoding. ViPer NL-COMM consists of a novel mathematical framework and an FPGA prototype capable of supporting large MIMO configurations (up to 16x16), high-order modulation (256-QAM), and wide bandwidths (100 MHz) within practical power and resource budgets. System-level evaluations demonstrate that ViPer NL-COMM achieves target error rates using only half the number of transmit antennas required by linear precoding, yielding net power savings on the order of hundreds of Watts at the RF front end. Moreover, ViPer NL-COMM enables supporting more information streams than available AP antennas when the streams are of low-rate, paving the way for enhanced massive-connectivity scenarios in next-generation wireless networks."}

First-order systems are used as a minimal yet expressive framework to illustrate how integration, differentiation, filtering, and delay manifest across the Laplace and Z domains. Particular attention is given to causality, bandwidth limitations, sampling effects, and the approximation errors inherent in discrete-time representations. The goal is to bridge the gap between formal mathematical descriptions and the intuition required for reliable system design in mixed analog-digital environments."}
