In\nthis paper, we investigate the ambiguity functions (AFs) of AFDM signals, which\nfundamentally characterize their range and velocity estimation capabilities in\nboth monostatic and bistatic settings. Specifically, we first derive the\nauto-ambiguity function (AAF) of an AFDM chirp subcarrier, revealing its\n\"spike-like\" local property and \"periodic-like\" global property along the\nrotated delay and Doppler dimensions. This structure naturally forms a\nparallelogram for each localized pulse of the AAF of the AFDM chirp subcarrier,\nenabling unambiguous target sensing. Then, we study the cross-ambiguity\nfunction (CAF) between two different AFDM chirp subcarriers, which exhibits the\nsame local and global properties as the AAF but with an additional shift along\nthe Doppler dimension. We then extend our analysis to the AF of various typical\nAFDM frames, considering both deterministic pilot and random data symbols. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that inserting guard symbols in AFDM facilitates\ninterference-free sensing. Simulation results validate our theoretical\nfindings, highlighting AFDM's strong potential for ISAC applications."}

On a cohort of 170 patients undergoing sleep apnea\nscreening, we evaluated whether this ODI value could represent a surrogate\nmarker for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for the diagnosis and severity\nassessment of sleep apnea. As the ODI was simultaneously obtained at the\nfingertip, upper arm and wrist, we compared ODI diagnostic performance\ndepending on the measurement location.

The perception is carried out by a\nspectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the\nsources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design\nprocess, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling\nISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other\nradio frequency (RF) sources. A key enabling requirement for the proposed\napplication is the capability to successfully recover possible missing data in\nthe frequency domain (induced by spectral notches) and in the slow-time\ndimension (enabling concurrent RF activities still in a cognitive fashion).\nThis process is carried out by resorting to advanced methods based on either\nthe compressed-sensing framework or a rank-minimization recovery strategy.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning\nsystems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote\nand non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR\nsystems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral\ninformation across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nConsequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the\nbiochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component\nsegmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial\nand spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving\nprecise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the\npotential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing\nhigh-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:\nground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three\npoint-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including\nkernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and\nrandom forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy\nof the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature\nvector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all\nthree wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into\nthe deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean\nintersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively.

In light of these findings, we propose a\nnovel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the\norder of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement.
