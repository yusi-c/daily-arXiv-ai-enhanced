However, learning-based methods often face challenges\nwith limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform\ncompared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While\niterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are\nconsiderably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,\nwe propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines\nthe strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better\nbalance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement\nentropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each\nvoxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it\nintroduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy\nreceives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level\nimage pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential\ncomplexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive\nlearning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature\nextraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to\noutperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching\nstate-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.

These orthogonal\nDMRS-also referred to as pilots-are effective in avoiding pilot contamination\nand interference from both the user's own data and that of others. However,\nthis approach incurs a significant overhead, as a substantial portion of the\ntime-frequency resources must be reserved for pilot transmission. Moreover, the\noverhead increases with the number of users and transmission layers.\n  To address these limitations in the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G)\nsystems and to support data transmission across the entire time-frequency grid,\nthe superposition of data and DMRS symbols has been explored as an alternative\nDMRS transmission strategy. In this study, we propose an enhanced version of\nDeepRx, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based receiver, capable of\nestimating the channel from received superimposed (SI) DMRS symbols and\nreliably detecting the transmitted data. We also design a conventional receiver\nfor comparison, which estimates the channel from SI DMRS using classical signal\nprocessing techniques.

While conventional\napproaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high\nrisks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to\ninnovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this\npaper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how\nthe MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular,\nwe consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs),\nspecifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres\ndeployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the\nmicrospheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and\nantagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant\nprotection products.

However, learning-based methods often face challenges\nwith limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform\ncompared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While\niterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are\nconsiderably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,\nwe propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines\nthe strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better\nbalance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement\nentropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each\nvoxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it\nintroduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy\nreceives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level\nimage pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential\ncomplexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive\nlearning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature\nextraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to\noutperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching\nstate-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.
