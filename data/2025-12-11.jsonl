However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving robust and balanced knowledge transfer across heterogeneous HSI scenes."}

Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent. This framework presents itself as a decision-support tool that can be used to respond to a pandemic, screen tuberculosis, and assess thoracic disease regularly in various healthcare facilities."}

However, conventional transport protocols are designed for bit-level reliability, failing to meet the semantic robustness requirements. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Information Transport Protocol (SITP), which achieves TCP-level reliability and UDP level latency by verifying only packet headers while retaining potentially corrupted payloads for semantic decoding. Building upon SITP, a cross-layer analytical model is established to quantify packet-loss probability across the physical, data-link, network, transport, and application layers. The model provides a unified probabilistic formulation linking signal noise rate (SNR) and packet-loss rate, offering theoretical foundation into end-to-end semantic transmission. Furthermore, a cross-image feature interleaving mechanism is developed to mitigate consecutive burst losses by redistributing semantic features across multiple correlated images, thereby enhancing robustness in burst-fade channels. Extensive experiments show that SITP offers lower latency than TCP with comparable reliability at low SNRs, while matching UDP-level latency and delivering superior reconstruction quality. In addition, the proposed cross-image semantic interleaving mechanism further demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating degradation caused by bursty packet losses."}

By leveraging the Swin Transformer, the proposed NOC4SC framework enables each user to independently extract semantic features through a unified encoder-decoder architecture with shared network parameters across all users, which ensures that the user's data remains protected from unauthorized decoding. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive NOC and SNR Modulation (NSM) block, which employs deep learning to dynamically regulate SNR and generate approximately orthogonal semantic features within distinct feature subspaces, thereby effectively mitigating inter-user interference.

However, single-orientation QSM inversion remains highly ill-posed because the dipole kernel exhibits a cone-null region in the Fourier domain, leading to streaking artifacts and structural loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose QSMnet-INR, a deep, physics-informed framework that integrates an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) into the k-space domain. The INR module continuously models multi-directional dipole responses and explicitly completes the cone-null region, while a frequency-domain residual-weighted Dipole Loss enforces physical consistency. The overall network combines a 3D U-Net-based QSMnet backbone with the INR module through alternating optimization for end-to-end joint training. Experiments on the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge, a multi-orientation GRE dataset, and both in-house and public single-orientation clinical data demonstrate that QSMnet-INR consistently outperforms conventional and recent deep-learning approaches across multiple quantitative metrics. The proposed framework shows notable advantages in structural recovery within cone-null regions and in artifact suppression. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of the INR module and Dipole Loss to detail preservation and physical stability. Overall, QSMnet-INR effectively alleviates the ill-posedness of single-orientation QSM without requiring multi-orientation acquisition, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and strong cross-scenario generalization-highlighting its potential for clinical translation."}

High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured."}

First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data.

Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity."}

The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $α$-$μ$ fading channels.

However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets."}

Similar to multisensory perception, Physical AI makes decisions based on multimodal updates from sensors and devices. Physical AI thus operates with a finite spatial footprint of its sensory tributaries. The multimodal updates traverse heterogeneous and unreliable paths, involving wireless links. Throughput or latency guarantees do not ensure correct decision-making, as misaligned, misordered, or stale inputs still yield wrong inferences. Preserving decision-time coherence hinges on three timing primitives at the network-application interface: (i) simultaneity, a short coincidence window that groups measurements as co-temporal, (ii) causality, path-wise delivery that never lets a consequence precede its precursor, and (iii) usefulness, a validity horizon that drops information too stale to influence the current action. In this work, we focus on usefulness and adopt temporal window of integration (TWI)-Causality: the TWI enforces decision-time usefulness by assuming path-wise causal consistency and cross-path simultaneity are handled upstream. We model end-to-end path delay as the sum of sensing/propagation, computation, and access/transmission latencies, and formulate network design as minimizing the validity horizon under a delivery reliability constraint. In effect, this calibrates delay-reliability budgets for a timing-aware system operating over sensors within a finite spatial footprint. The joint choice of horizon and per-path reliability is cast as a convex optimization problem, solved to global optimality to obtain the minimal horizon and per-path allocation of reliability. This is compared favourably to a benchmark based on uniform-after-threshold allocation. Overall, this study contributes to timing-aware Physical AI in next-generation networks."}

Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals."}

Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission."}

Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines."}
