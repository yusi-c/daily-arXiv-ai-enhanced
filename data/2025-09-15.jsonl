Developing\naccurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated\ndata, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by\nproviding researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared\nlearning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of\ncrowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing\n353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The\ndata was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out\nvalidation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background\npatterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a\nmachine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity\nof EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4\nperforming models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation\ndataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,\ndeep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had\na significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing\nperformance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen\ndata, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with\nneonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on\nlarge and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation.

To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages.

A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG.

This repository\nstores consistent MFs of high quality that are collected during prior\ntraversals. We integrate these GMFs back into the MP-SLAM framework via a\nprobability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates GMF intensity\nfunctions over time. Extensive simulations, together with a challenging\nreal-world experiment using LTE RF signals in a dense urban scenario with\nsevere multipath propagation and inter-cell interference, demonstrate that our\nframework achieves robust and accurate localization, thereby showcasing its\neffectiveness in realistic modern cellular networks such as 5G or future 6G\nnetworks. It outperforms conventional proprioceptive sensor-based localization\nand conventional MP-SLAM methods, and achieves reliable localization even under\nadverse signal conditions."}
