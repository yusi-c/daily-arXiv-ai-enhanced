The digital twin integrates an\nelectromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray\ntracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be\ntrained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further\ndevelop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into\nfour key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware\nmodeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data\nand model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments,\nwe propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of\nreal-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin\ndataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital\ntwins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed\nrefinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world\ndata. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity,\nespecially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving\nCSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights\ninto the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin\ndevelopment and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks."}

Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC\nsystem design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are\nmainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD\ndomain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we\npropose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in\nhigh-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel\nmeasurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system.\nSecond, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary\ninterval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly,\nthe quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third,\nvia LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the\ndecision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different\nchannel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of\nproposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of\nOTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the\nquasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on\nmillisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the\nquasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude.

In this context, this paper investigates a vehicular\ncommunication system assisted by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which\nadjusts its trajectory and resource allocation according to communication\nneeds. The system classifies vehicles into two groups to address their varying\nservice requirements: emergency vehicles, which require a minimum instantaneous\ndata rate to access critical information timely, and normal vehicles. To\nsupport both categories effectively, this paper proposes a joint optimization\napproach that coordinates UAV trajectory planning and Dynamic Bandwidth\nAllocation (DBA). The objective is to maximize the minimum average data rate\nfor normal vehicles while ensuring that emergency vehicles maintain an\ninstantaneous rate above a predefined threshold. This approach takes into\naccount some system constraints, including UAV propulsion power consumption,\nmobility limitations, and backhaul capacity.

A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links.
