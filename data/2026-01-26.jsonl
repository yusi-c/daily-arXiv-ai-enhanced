In medical imagining applications the most coveted property for effective deployment is Single Domain Generalization (SDG), which addresses the challenge of training a model on a single domain to ensure it generalizes well to unseen target domains. In multi-center studies, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare class characteristics. This paper presents our experience on SDG in real life deployment for two exemplary medical imaging case studies on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, and stress electrocardiogram based coronary artery detection. Utilizing the commonly used application of diabetic retinopathy, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art SDG techniques fail to achieve generalized performance across data domains. We then develop a generic expert knowledge integrated deep learning technique DL+EKE and instantiate it for the DR application and show that DL+EKE outperforms SOTA SDG methods on DR. We then deploy instances of DL+EKE technique on the two real world examples of stress ECG and resting state (rs)-fMRI and discuss issues faced with SDG techniques."}

However, most of these methods are supervised and require some data with ground truth for training, which is often non-available. To overcome this problem, we propose a new unsupervised training strategy for the super-resolution of hyperspectral remote sensing images, based on the use of synthetic abundance data. Its first step decomposes the hyperspectral image into abundances and endmembers by unmixing. Then, an abundance super-resolution neural network is trained using synthetic abundances, which are generated using the dead leaves model in such a way as to faithfully mimic real abundance statistics. Next, the spatial resolution of the considered hyperspectral image abundances is increased using this trained network, and the high resolution hyperspectral image is finally obtained by recombination with the endmembers. Experimental results show the training potential of the synthetic images, and demonstrate the method effectiveness."}

Major challenges include detecting small objects, handling ambiguous boundaries, and addressing class imbalance. To address these issues, we propose PanopMamba, a novel hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer with additional feature-enhanced fusion via state space modeling. We design a multiscale Mamba backbone and a State Space Model (SSM)-based fusion network to enable efficient long-range perception in pyramid features, thereby extending the pure encoder-decoder framework while facilitating information sharing across multiscale features of nuclei. The proposed SSM-based feature-enhanced fusion integrates pyramid feature networks and dynamic feature enhancement across different spatial scales, enhancing the feature representation of densely overlapping nuclei in both semantic and spatial dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Mamba-based approach for panoptic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce alternative evaluation metrics, including image-level Panoptic Quality ($i$PQ), boundary-weighted PQ ($w$PQ), and frequency-weighted PQ ($fw$PQ), which are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of nuclei segmentation and thereby mitigate the potential bias inherent in vanilla PQ. Experimental evaluations on two multiclass nuclei segmentation benchmark datasets, MoNuSAC2020 and NuInsSeg, demonstrate the superiority of PanopMamba for nuclei panoptic segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, the robustness of PanopMamba is validated across various metrics, while the distinctiveness of PQ variants is also demonstrated.

A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms."}

Considering a large set of gestures, distinct patterns are difficult to be captured by learning algorithms using backscattered received signal strength (RSS) and phase signals. This is because these features often exhibit similarities across signals from different gestures. To address this limitation, we explore the estimation of Angle of Arrival (AoA) as a distinguishing feature, since AoA characteristically varies during body motion. To ensure reliable estimation in our system, which employs Smart Antenna Switching (SAS), we first validate AoA estimation using the Multiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm while the tags are fixed at specific angles. Building on this, we propose an AoA tracking method based on Kalman smoothing. Our analysis demonstrates that, while RSS and phase alone are insufficient for distinguishing certain gesture data, AoA tracking can effectively differentiate them. To evaluate the effectiveness of AoA tracking, we implement gesture recognition system benchmarks and show that incorporating AoA features significantly boosts their performance. Improvements of up to 15% confirm the value of AoA-based enhancement."}

This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the \"cocktail party\" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method."}

Submitted to an IEEE journal for possible publication", "summary": "Cell-free networks leverage distributed access points (APs) to achieve macro-diversity, yet their performance is often constrained by large disparities in channel quality arising from user geometry and blockages. To address this, rotatable antennas (RAs) add a lightweight hardware degree of freedom by steering the antenna boresight toward dominant propagation directions to strengthen unfavorable links, thereby enabling the network to better exploit macro-diversity for higher and more uniform performance. This paper investigates an RA-enabled cell-free downlink network and formulates a max-min rate problem that jointly optimizes transmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop an alternating-optimization-based algorithm that iteratively updates the beamformers via a second-order cone program (SOCP) and optimizes the antenna orientations using successive convex approximation. To reduce complexity, we further propose an efficient two-stage scheme that first designs orientations by maximizing a proportional-fair log-utility using manifold-aware Frank-Wolfe updates, and then computes the beamformers using an SOCP-based design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed orientation-aware designs achieve a substantially higher worst-user rate than conventional beamforming-only benchmarks. Furthermore, larger antenna directivity enhances fairness with proper orientation but can degrade the worst-user performance otherwise."}

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a novel generation of neural networks inspired by the highly efficient human brain. By emulating its event-driven and energy-efficient mechanisms, SNNs enable low-power, real-time signal processing. They differ from ANNs in two key ways: they exhibit inherent temporal dynamics and process and transmit information as short binary signals called spikes. Despite their promise, major challenges remain, e.g., identifying optimal learning rules and effective neural encoding. This thesis investigates the design of SNN-based receivers for nonlinear time-invariant frequency-selective channels. Backpropagation through time with surrogate gradients is identified as a promising update rule and the novel quantization encoding (QE) as promising neural encoding. Given the model of the intensity modulation with direct detection link, we compare two different receiver architectures based on equalization performance and spike count. Using decision feedback and QE achieves both strong performance and low spike counts. Notably, SNN-based receivers significantly outperform ANN-based counterparts. We furthermore introduce policy gradient-based update (PGU), an reinforcement learning-based update algorithm that requires no backpropagation. Using PGU, encoding parameters are optimized, drastically reducing runtime, complexity, and spikes per inference while maintaining performance.

Moreover, compared to classical vector-based solutions, the proposed architecture decodes the navigation message in the loop, without the need to run scalar loops in parallel or having to store pre-downloaded ephemeris data.

A semi analytical optimization framework is employed to jointly optimize rate and energy loss, allowing the selection of the number of hierarchical layers, memory size, and block length required to optimize channel capacity. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through probabilistic amplitude shaping of 16QAM (PAS 16QAM), showing good agreement between analytical predictions and simulated results. The proposed analytical tool facilitates the design of HiDM structures that are compatible with practical hardware and implementation constraints, such as those imposed by state-of-the-art application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore, the performance of the optimized HiDM structure, incorporating layer selection based on lower-bound energy loss, is evaluated over the AWGN channel in terms of normalized generalized mutual information (NGMI) as a function of the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR).

The research presents the derived closed-form channel coefficient envelope statistics for the single IRS-element channel with IPL statistics in both subchannels and total IRS-assisted channel, as well as tight approximations for the channel coefficient and instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) statistics for the latter. The derived expressions helped estimate channel parameters corresponding to the specific HRRs of the total channel and demonstrate that while both single links (i.e., ''source-IRS'' and ''IRS-destination'') are in full-HRR, the minimum number of IRS elements needed to bring the total IRS-assisted link (''source-IRS-destination'') out of full-HRR is no less than $6$ (for the whole range on the IPL scale parameter corresponding full-HRR). Furthermore, the minimum number of IRS elements required to bring the total IRS-assisted link into no-HRR is $14$ (under the same conditions)."}

However, most of these methods are supervised and require some data with ground truth for training, which is often non-available. To overcome this problem, we propose a new unsupervised training strategy for the super-resolution of hyperspectral remote sensing images, based on the use of synthetic abundance data. Its first step decomposes the hyperspectral image into abundances and endmembers by unmixing. Then, an abundance super-resolution neural network is trained using synthetic abundances, which are generated using the dead leaves model in such a way as to faithfully mimic real abundance statistics. Next, the spatial resolution of the considered hyperspectral image abundances is increased using this trained network, and the high resolution hyperspectral image is finally obtained by recombination with the endmembers. Experimental results show the training potential of the synthetic images, and demonstrate the method effectiveness."}

Major challenges include detecting small objects, handling ambiguous boundaries, and addressing class imbalance. To address these issues, we propose PanopMamba, a novel hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer with additional feature-enhanced fusion via state space modeling. We design a multiscale Mamba backbone and a State Space Model (SSM)-based fusion network to enable efficient long-range perception in pyramid features, thereby extending the pure encoder-decoder framework while facilitating information sharing across multiscale features of nuclei. The proposed SSM-based feature-enhanced fusion integrates pyramid feature networks and dynamic feature enhancement across different spatial scales, enhancing the feature representation of densely overlapping nuclei in both semantic and spatial dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Mamba-based approach for panoptic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce alternative evaluation metrics, including image-level Panoptic Quality ($i$PQ), boundary-weighted PQ ($w$PQ), and frequency-weighted PQ ($fw$PQ), which are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of nuclei segmentation and thereby mitigate the potential bias inherent in vanilla PQ. Experimental evaluations on two multiclass nuclei segmentation benchmark datasets, MoNuSAC2020 and NuInsSeg, demonstrate the superiority of PanopMamba for nuclei panoptic segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, the robustness of PanopMamba is validated across various metrics, while the distinctiveness of PQ variants is also demonstrated.
