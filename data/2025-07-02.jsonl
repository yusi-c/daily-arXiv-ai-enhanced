However, 4D mitral valve (MV)\nanalysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion\nartifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency\nin existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a\nMotion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV\nultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only\nsparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a\ncross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a\nbi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.\nThis enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.\nSecond, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that\nexplores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.\nTherefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between\nlabeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV\ndataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior\ncross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:\n1.75mm).

However, from a clinical perspective image quality\nis only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant\ninformation is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data.\nIn this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering\nresampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small\nand rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions\n(false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we\npropose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\\SDR), a method which, given\nan original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced\nsemantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured\ndata.

Traditionally,\nsegmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting\ntheir ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced\nmodels can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater\nflexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained\nattention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based\non user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated\nwork on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,\nespecially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,\ngenerating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from\nmultiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,\nspecifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we\nintroduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple\norgans and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage\nfeature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for\nbetter spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.\nCompared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,\nour model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest\nX-rays based on user prompts."}
