This raises a key\nquestion: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs\nfor solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates\ncommon and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering\n(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf\nperformance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges\nthese gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen\nmedical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in\nID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after\nlightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective\namong different tasks.

Conventional Bayesian\nmultiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT)\napproach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract\nmeasurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can\ndiscard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability\nto resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD)\nparadigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data. However,\nexisting TBD approaches introduce simplifications to facilitate the development\nof inference methods, such as assuming known signal amplitudes or conditional\nindependence between sensor measurements given object states. These assumptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting\nTBD methods in realistic scenarios.\n  This paper introduces coherent TBD based on a comprehensive signal model for\nsensor data. The new model accounts for sensor data correlations and amplitude\nfluctuations, enabling the accurate representation of the physics of the\ndata-generating process in TBD. Coherent TBD is suitable for a wide range of\nproblems in active and passive radar, active and passive sonar, as well as\nintegrated sensing and communication systems. Based on a factor graph\nrepresentation of the new measurement model, a scalable belief propagation (BP)\nmethod is developed to perform efficient Bayesian inference. Experimental\nresults, performed with both synthetic and real data, demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms state-of-the-art conventional MOT methods."}

This is particularly\nbeneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are\nsignificantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as\na widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.\nNeural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to\nmodel evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we\nintroduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further\nrefines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled\nimaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling\nadaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to\nresemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a\nphysiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement.

Traditional methods typically optimize wireless system parameters\nbased on channel state information (CSI). However, obtaining accurate CSI\nrequires extensive pilot transmissions, which lead to increased overhead and\nlatency. Moreover, the optimization of user association and beamforming is a\ndiscrete and non-convex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve\nanalytically. In this paper, we propose to incorporate visual camera data in\naddition to the RF pilots to perform the joint optimization of user association\nand beamforming. The visual image data helps enhance channel awareness, thereby\nreducing the dependency on extensive pilot transmissions for system\noptimization. We employ a learning-based approach based on using first a\ndetection neural network that estimates user locations from images, and\nsubsequently two graph neural networks (GNNs) that extract features for system\noptimization based on the location information and the received pilots,\nrespectively. Then, a multimodal GNN is constructed to integrate the features\nfor the joint optimization user association and beamforming.

Nevertheless, integrating traditional\ninference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the\nerror progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems,\ngenerative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased\nattention.

With diffusion models,\nwe can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate\ntraditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the\ndiffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the\ndiffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying\nnoise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing\ntraining and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot\ndensities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces\nchannel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading\ndeep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in\nlow-pilot conditions.
