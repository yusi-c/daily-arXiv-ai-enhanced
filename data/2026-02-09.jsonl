However, when trained with sparse input views, 3DGS suffers from overfitting and structural degradation, leading to poor generalization on novel views. This limitation arises from its optimization relying solely on photometric loss without incorporating any 3D structure priors. To address this issue, we propose Coherent supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors (COSMOS). Inspired by the concept of superpoints from 3D segmentation, COSMOS introduces 3D structure priors by newly defining supergaussian groupings of Gaussians based on local geometric cues and appearance features. To this end, COSMOS applies inter group global self-attention across supergaussian groups and sparse local attention among individual Gaussians, enabling the integration of global and local spatial information. These structure-aware features are then used for predicting Gaussian attributes, facilitating more consistent 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, by leveraging supergaussian-based grouping, COSMOS enforces an intra-group positional regularization to maintain structural coherence and suppress floaters, thereby enhancing training stability under sparse-view conditions. Our experiments on Blender and DTU show that COSMOS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in sparse-view settings without any external depth supervision."}

However, the original study did not include explicit generalization tests to assess how well the NN would perform on previously unseen data, which prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the model's robustness and applicability in diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted additional generalization assessments, the results of which are presented in this case study. These results serve both to complement and to refine the original analysis reported in [1]. Most importantly, the overall conclusions of the initial study remain valid: the NN is still able to reduce the PAPR level to a desired reference value, also with a lower computational cost, confirming the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method across a more generalized setting."}

This can lead to suboptimal chroma quality and inefficiencies in bitrate allocation. We propose an Adaptive Resolution-Chroma Subsampling (ARCS) framework that jointly optimizes spatial resolution and chroma subsampling to balance perceptual quality and decoding efficiency. ARCS selects an optimal (resolution, chroma format) pair for each bitrate by maximizing a composite quality-complexity objective, while enforcing monotonicity constraints to ensure smooth transitions between representations. Experimental results using x265 show that, compared to a fixed-format encoding (YUV444), on average, ARCS achieves a 13.48 % bitrate savings and a 62.18 % reduction in decoding time, which we use as a proxy for the decoding energy, to yield the same colorVideoVDP score. The proposed framework introduces chroma adaptivity as a new control dimension for energy-efficient video streaming."}

Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches."}

Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware.\n  Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit.

This paper proposes a content-adaptive framework that predicts frame-level bit consumption using lightweight features from the Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and quantization parameters within a Random Forest regression. On ultra-high-definition sequences encoded with VVenC, the model achieves strong correlation with ground truth, yielding R2 values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.77 for I-, P-, and B-frames, respectively. Integrated into a rate-control loop, it achieves comparable coding efficiency to 2pRC while reducing total encoding time by 33.3%. The results show that VCA-driven bit prediction provides a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to conventional rate-QP models."}

We start with a meticulous analysis of LUMIR24 winners to identify the main contributors to good monomodal registration performance. To achieve good generalization with diverse contrasts from a model trained with T1-weighted MRI only, we employ three simple but effective strategies: (i) a multimodal loss based on the modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND), (ii) intensity randomization for appearance augmentation, and (iii) lightweight instance-specific optimization (ISO) on feature encoders at inference time. On the validation set, our approach achieves reasonable T1-T2 registration accuracy while maintaining good deformation regularity."}

We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement."}

However, existing deep learning approaches, such as CNN and Transformer, often fail to explicitly capture the directional geometric features of artifacts, leading to compromised structural restoration. To address these limitations, we propose the Asymmetric Self-Guided Mamba (AS-Mamba) for metal artifact reduction. Specifically, the linear propagation of metal-induced streak artifacts aligns well with the sequential modeling capability of State Space Models (SSMs). Consequently, the Mamba architecture is leveraged to explicitly capture and suppress these directional artifacts. Simultaneously, a frequency domain correction mechanism is incorporated to rectify the global amplitude spectrum, thereby mitigating intensity inhomogeneity caused by beam hardening. Furthermore, to bridge the distribution gap across diverse clinical scenarios, we introduce a self-guided contrastive regularization strategy. Extensive experiments on public andclinical dental CBCT datasets demonstrate that AS-Mamba achieves superior performance in suppressing directional streaks and preserving structural details, validating the effectiveness of integrating physical geometric priors into deep network design."}

Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions.

In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal."}
