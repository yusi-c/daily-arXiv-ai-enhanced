This procedure aims to maintain both\nvisual authenticity and structural integrity while reducing the dimensions of\nan image at a large scale to fit the dimension of the display devices. In this\nstudy, we proposed a new technique for downscaling images that uses\nco-occurrence learning to maintain structural and perceptual information while\nreducing resolution. The technique uses the input image to create a data-driven\nco-occurrence profile that captures the frequency of intensity correlations in\nnearby neighborhoods. A refined filtering process is guided by this profile,\nwhich acts as a content-adaptive range kernel. The contribution of each input\npixel is based on how closely it resembles pair-wise intensity values with it's\nneighbors. We validate our proposed technique on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100,\nUrban100, and RealSR to show its effective downscaling capacity. Our technique\ncould obtain up to 39.22 dB PSNR on the DIV2K dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 on\nthe same dataset when downscaling by 8x and 16x, respectively. Numerous\nexperimental findings attest to the ability of the suggested picture\ndownscaling method to outperform more contemporary approaches in terms of both\nvisual quality and performance measures. Unlike most existing methods, which\ndid not focus on the large-scale image resizing scenario, we achieve\nhigh-quality downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring. Our\nmethod, LSID (large scale image downscaling), successfully preserves\nhigh-frequency structures like edges, textures, and repeating patterns by\nfocusing on statistically consistent pixels while reducing aliasing and\nblurring artifacts that are typical of traditional downscaling techniques."}

To answer the first question, we introduce a\nFisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which\nyields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal\npatterns.

Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger\npatients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without\ncomorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation\nbased on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports\nthe critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from\nthreshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is\nfeasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work\nshould enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to\ninclude therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension\nprediction systems."}

Although various\nhigh power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with\nthe CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink\ntransmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)\nwaveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while\nmaintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.\nSpecifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a\nCP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design\nof an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band\nemissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat\nfrequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain\nbinary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then\npropose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay\nprofile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.\nSubsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE\nequalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE\nreceived signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase\ncaused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme\nincluding multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and\ncorresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the\nNew Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme\nachieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly\nreducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions."}

However, channel aging\ncaused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,\nleading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this\nissue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages\ntemporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the\neffective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),\nensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring\ncontinuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep\nneural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The\nsimulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up\nto 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps\nthroughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler\nconditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI\nprediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in\nTDD 5G systems."}

Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and\nestimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by\ntraditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver\nefficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\nsystems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI\nproblem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently\ndeal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with\ntraditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver\ndesign of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential\nof DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions\nbrought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further\nadapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance."}

Since the phase information\nin the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the\nestimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable\npixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form\nof coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on\nclosure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information\nin the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well\na resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according\nto the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and\nan ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original\nestimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking\nmethods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss\ncomputational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit\nindicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with\nexplicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of\ndifferent size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate\nthat the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the\ngoodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes\nestablished quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions\nthat fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic\npixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of\ndistributed scatterers."}

However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively\nhigh frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical\nscale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system\napplications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is\npresented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional\napplications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of\nelectronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and\ndesigned by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.\nSimulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve\nwideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180\ndegree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25\nGHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was\ndesigned, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding\nsequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum\n(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.\nThese capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through\nhigh-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as\nphysical-layer security.
