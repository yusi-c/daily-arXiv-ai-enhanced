Deep learning methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions but often overfit to a fixed acquisition setup, failing to generalize across sampling rates and image resolutions. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use the same learned kernels across resolutions, leading to artifacts when data resolution changes.\n  We propose Computed Tomography neural Operator (CTO), a unified CT reconstruction framework that extends to continuous function space, enabling generalization (without retraining) across sampling rates and image resolutions.

Empirically, CTO enables consistent multi-sampling-rate and cross-resolution performance, with on average >4dB PSNR gain over CNNs. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion methods, CTO is 500$\\times$ faster in inference time with on average 3dB gain. Empirical results also validate our design choices behind CTO's sinogram-space operator learning and rotation-equivariant convolution.

However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.\n  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss.

These techniques have demonstrated that constructing content-gnostic per-shot bitrate ladders can provide significant bitrate gains and improved Quality of Experience (QoE) for viewers under various network conditions. However, constructing a convex hull for every video incurs a significant computational overhead. Recently, machine learning-based bitrate ladder construction techniques have emerged as a substitute for convex hull construction. These methods operate by extracting features from source videos to train machine learning (ML) models to construct content-adaptive bitrate ladders. Here, we present a new ML-based bitrate ladder construction technique that accurately predicts the VMAF scores of compressed videos, by analyzing the compression procedure and by making perceptually relevant measurements on the source videos prior to compression. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against leading prior methods on a large corpus of videos. Since training ML models on every encoder setting is time-consuming, we also investigate how per-shot bitrate ladders perform under different encoding settings. We evaluate the performance of all models against the fixed bitrate ladder and the best possible convex hull constructed using exhaustive encoding with Bjontegaard-delta metrics."}

We sought to assess the performance of a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model for automated fetal renal anomaly classification using a curated dataset of 969 two-dimensional ultrasound images. A pretrained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) was fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification of normal kidneys, urinary tract dilation, and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Models were compared with a DenseNet-169 convolutional baseline using cross-validation and an independent test set. USF-MAE consistently improved upon the baseline across all evaluation metrics in both binary and multi-class settings. USF-MAE achieved an improvement of about 1.87% (AUC) and 7.8% (F1-score) on the validation set, 2.32% (AUC) and 4.33% (F1-score) on the independent holdout test set. The largest gains were observed in the multi-class setting, where the improvement in AUC was 16.28% and 46.15% in F1-score. To facilitate model interpretability, Score-CAM visualizations were adapted for a transformer architecture and show that model predictions were informed by known, clinically relevant renal structures, including the renal pelvis in urinary tract dilation and cystic regions in multicystic dysplastic kidney. These results show that ultrasound-specific self-supervised learning can generate a useful representation as a foundation for downstream diagnostic tasks.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for VOC-based interplant MC from an ICT perspective. The communication process is divided into three stages: transmission (VOC biosynthesis and emission from leaves), channel propagation (advection-diffusion in turbulent wind via Gaussian puff for stress-induced VOC release and Gaussian plume for constitutive VOC release), and reception (VOC uptake and physiological response in the receiver plant). Each stage is analyzed by its attenuation and delay. Numerical results demonstrate that VOC-based channels exhibit low-pass behavior, with bandwidth and capacity heavily influenced by distance, wind velocity, and noise. Though the physical channel supports moderate frequencies, biological constraints at the transmitter restrict the end-to-end channel to slow-varying signals."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-aperture FSO receiver architecture that leverages spatial diversity across a lens array to decouple these intertwined effects. Building on this hardware design, we propose a hierarchical deep learning framework that sequentially estimates AoA, transmitter pointing error, and turbulence coefficients. This decomposition significantly reduces learning complexity and enables robust inference even under strong atmospheric fading. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-MAP accuracy with orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost, and substantially outperforms end-to-end learning baselines in terms of estimation accuracy and generalization.

Unlike conventional Gaussian-beam acquisition systems that rely on multiple sequential beams or mechanical steering, the proposed approach employs two orthogonal line-shaped laser beams to perform structured optical scanning over the ambiguity region without any moving parts. A physics-based model incorporating atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and MRR-based reflection is developed, and a data-driven neural estimator is trained to map received optical energy patterns to the satellite's two-dimensional position.

To address this limitation, we propose a new rotatable antenna array (RAA) architecture in this paper, which enables three-dimensional (3D) rotational control of an antenna array to provide enhanced spatial flexibility for null steering. To characterize its performance, we aim to jointly optimize the 3D rotational angles of the RAA, to maximize the beam gain over a given desired direction, while nulling those over multiple interference directions under zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. However, this problem is non-convex and challenging to tackle due to the highly nonlinear expression of the beam gain in terms of the rotational angles. To gain insights, we first examine several special cases including both isotropic and directional antenna radiation patterns, deriving the conditions under which full beam gain can be achieved over the desired direction while meeting the nulling constraints for interference directions. These conditions clearly indicate that compared with FOA arrays, RAAs can significantly relax the angular separation requirement for achieving effective null steering. For other general cases, we propose a sequential update algorithm, that iteratively refines the 3D rotational angles by discretizing the 3D angular search space. To avoid undesired local optimum, a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure is also employed between two consecutive rounds of sequential update for solution exploration. Simulation results verify our analytical results and show superior null-steering performance of RAAs to FOA arrays."}

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution for 6G networks due to its energy efficiency (EE) and low cost, while cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) was proposed as an innovative network architecture without fixed cell boundaries to enhance these measures even further. However, existing studies often assume consistently high traffic loads, neglecting the dynamic nature of user demand. This can result in underutilized access points (APs) and unnecessary energy expenditure during low-demand periods. To tackle the challenge of EE in CF-mMIMO systems during low load periods, this paper proposes a novel energy-efficient transmission scheme that jointly coordinates active APs and multiple passive RISs. Specifically, a dynamic AP sleep-mode strategy is designed, where certain APs are selectively deactivated while nearby RISs assist in maintaining coverage. We formulate the EE maximization objective as a fractional programming problem and adopt the Dinkelbach method in conjunction with alternating optimization (AO) to iteratively solve the three coupled subproblems: (i) AP selection via a hybrid branch-and-bound (BnB) and greedy algorithm, (ii) transmit power optimization using a sequential convex approximation (SCA) method, initialized by a heuristic zero-forcing strategy, and (iii) RIS phase shift optimization using gradient projection.

To answer these questions, we conduct an empirical study on two representative tasks: CSI compression and temporal channel prediction. Models are trained and evaluated using in-domain, cross-domain, and small-data fine-tuning protocols. Across settings, we observe that stochastic-only evaluation may over- or under-estimate performance relative to RT.

A channel state information (CSI) based precoder is designed at the access point (AP) to suppress MU interference, enabling interference free reception for the legitimate users. To further enhance secrecy performance, we formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes the secrecy sum rate using an alternating optimization (AO) framework, which iteratively updates the active beamforming at the AP, user power allocation, and the RIS phase shift matrix. The highly nonconvex problem is addressed under the Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) framework and solved using a Riemannian Conjugate Gradient (RCG) algorithm for RIS phase shift design. Simulation results verify that the proposed framework effectively enhances the secrecy sum rate and eliminates interference, demonstrating its potential for secure and scalable CFmMIMO networks in dense wireless environments."}

Thus, they are unable to capture potentially important dynamics occurring on the edges. In this work, we adopt an edge-centric GSP approach to analyze edge signals constructed from 100 unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome Project. Specifically, we describe structural connectivity through the lens of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian, processing signals defined on edges to capture co-fluctuation information between brain regions. We demonstrate that edge-based approaches achieve superior task decoding accuracy in static and dynamic scenarios compared to conventional node-based techniques, thereby unveiling unique aspects of brain functional organization. These findings underscore the promise of edge-focused GSP strategies for deepening our understanding of brain connectivity and functional dynamics."}

Michael Buehrer"], "title": "Interference Mitigation Recommender System using U-Net Autoencoders", "comment": null, "summary": "Building on the previous work on interference mitigation, this paper introduces a modular recommender system that automatically selects the most effective interference mitigation strategy based on the interference characteristics present in the received signal. The system integrates three key stages: an SPS classifier module, a SIR predictor, and a bank of specialized U-Net autoencoders designed for different interference conditions. The classification block identifies the parameters required for cancellation. The recommender then directs the signal to the appropriate mitigation model, optionally incorporating SIR-based decisions for scenarios where successive interference cancellation may be advantageous. Experiments conducted across diverse SIR levels and modulation environments show that the recommender strategy improves robustness and reduces BER compared to using any single mitigation method alone. The results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, model-selective architectures to enhance interference resilience in dynamic communication environments."}

Michael Buehrer"], "title": "On the Ability of Deep Learning to Detect Signals with Unknown Parameters", "comment": null, "summary": "In many signal processing applications, including communications, sonar, radar, and localization, a fundamental problem is the detection of a signal of interest in background noise, known as signal detection [1] [2]. A simple version of this problem is the detection of a signal of interest with unknown parameters in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). When the parameters defining the signal are not known, an optimal detector (in the Neyman-Pearson sense) does not exist. An upper bound on the performance of any detector is the matched filter, which implies perfect sample by sample knowledge of the signal of interest. In recent years Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be very effective at hypothesis testing problems such as object detection and image classification. This paper examines the application of DNN-based approaches to the signal detection problem at the raw I/Q level and compares them to statistically based approaches as well as the Matched Filter. These methods aim to maximize the Probability of Detection Pd while maintaining a constant Probability of False Alarm PF A. Two Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are trained and assessed on this signal detection problem, across three signal of interest models. A model was also trained on a unified dataset and assessed across all signals of interest."}

Multi-bit modulators allow balancing complexity and speed by reducing the clock frequency and increasing the number of levels in the quantizer. In this case, the multi-bit digital to analog block (DAC) can reduce the performance of the entire system. Data Weighted Averaging (DWA) methods have been proposed to reduce the vulnerability to DAC errors at the cost of spurious tones in the signal band. This work analyzes the tone producing mechanism and proposes a modification of the DWA to remove spurious tones."}

Akan"], "title": "Performance Limits of Hardware-Constrained THz Inter-Satellite MIMO-ISAC Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Terahertz inter-satellite links (THz-ISL) offer unprecedented bandwidth for future space networks but face fundamental constraints from onboard power and thermal budgets. This paper establishes theoretical performance limits for MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems under per-element constant-envelope (CE) transmission constraints. We demonstrate that hardware distortions -- specifically power amplifier nonlinearity, ADC quantization, and oscillator phase noise -- impose a capacity ceiling that cannot be overcome by increasing transmit power. A unified link budget framework integrates wideband beam squint, aperture pointing errors, and colored noise sources through a spectral consistency principle that ensures residual phase noise is counted exactly once across communication and sensing analyses. The sensing bounds are derived via the Whittle-Fisher Information Matrix under a Constant Acceleration kinematic model with jerk noise, yielding closed-form scaling laws: residual phase noise variance scales as $α^{-1}$ while dynamic state-estimation error (DSE) variance scales as $α^{-5}$ with pilot overhead $α$. Numerical results show divergent MIMO scaling: sensing precision improves with array size ($\\mathrm{RMSE} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_t N_r}$), while the critical SNR exhibits scale invariance regarding array size, implying that the distortion-limited transition point stabilizes regardless of the array scale. The steep $α^{-5}$ DSE scaling creates an operationally infeasible region at $α< α^* \\approx 0.16$, where $α^* = (C_{\\mathrm{DSE}}/C_{\\mathrm{PN}})^{1/4}$ -- a constraint-driven threshold under the adopted baseline for LEO operation. These findings provide design guidelines for hardware-efficient THz-ISL constellations."}
