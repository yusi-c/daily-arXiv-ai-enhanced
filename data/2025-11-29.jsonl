During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications."}

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness."}

Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system.

Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter."}

This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale."}

However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements."}

Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies."}

However, unlike discrete signal representations such as voxel grids, neural fields cannot be easily extended. As neural fields are, in essence, neural networks, prior signals represented in a neural field will degrade when the model is presented with new data due to catastrophic forgetting. This work examines the extent to which different neural field approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting and proposes a strategy to mitigate this issue. We consider the scenario in which data becomes available incrementally, with only the most recent data available for neural field fitting. In a series of experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we demonstrate how knowledge distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting when the spatiotemporal domain is enlarged or the dimensionality of the represented signal is increased. We find that the amount of catastrophic forgetting depends, to a large extent, on the neural fields model used, and that distillation could enable continual learning in neural fields."}

We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations."}

We propose a novel deep learning framework to address these issues. Our method introduces a semantic-enhanced hybrid feature descriptor, which fuses the geometric precision of local features with the contextual robustness of a vision foundation model DINOV3 to bridge the modality gap. To handle complex deformations, we replace traditional RANSAC with a learnable Geometric Consistency Confidence Module, a novel classifier trained to identify and reject physically implausible correspondences. A data-efficient two-stage training strategy, involving pre-training on synthetically deformed data and fine-tuning on limited real data, overcomes the data scarcity problem.

This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance.

The NR signal transformation is not yet supported. A transformation technique that applies the same partitioning to the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases and finds a sparse representation of the NR signal in such a dictionary showed promising gains in an experimental setup outside the reference software. This method uses the regular inverse transformation at the decoder to reconstruct a rectangular signal and discards the signal outside the region of interest. This design is appealing due to the minimal changes required at the decoder. However, current entropy coding schemes are not well-suited for optimally encoding these coefficients because they are primarily designed for DCT coefficients. This work introduces an entropy coding method that efficiently codes these transform coefficients by effectively modeling their properties.

The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space.
