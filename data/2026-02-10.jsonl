However, the rapid growth of terrestrial devices intensifies spectrum sharing between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments, resulting in severe cross-tier interference. In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed DDPG framework optimizes the HAPS beamforming weights to form spatial nulls toward interference sources while maintaining robust links to the desired signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG framework consistently outperforms conventional ZF beamforming among different RIS configurations, achieving up to \\(11.3\\%\\) throughput improvement for a \\(4\\times4\\) RIS configuration, validating its adaptive capability to enhance spectral efficiency in dynamic HAPS-based SAGINs."}

In this study, we present a theoretical analysis of diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss, highlighting the latter's advantages. We present a theoretical comparison of conditional diffusion and autoregressive diffusion with diffusion loss, demonstrating that patch denoising optimization in autoregressive models effectively mitigates condition errors and leads to a stable condition distribution. Our analysis also reveals that autoregressive condition generation refines the condition, causing the condition error influence to decay exponentially. In addition, we introduce a novel condition refinement approach based on Optimal Transport (OT) theory to address ``condition inconsistency''. We theoretically demonstrate that formulating condition refinement as a Wasserstein Gradient Flow ensures convergence toward the ideal condition distribution, effectively mitigating condition inconsistency. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss methods."}

The core of our proposed methodology is a preliminary Doppler trace extraction stage, implemented to amplify salient motion-related signal features before classification. Subsequently, these enhanced inputs are processed by a hybrid neural architecture, which integrates Inception networks responsible for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks that capture temporal dependencies. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then utilized as the final classification layer to optimize decision boundaries. The framework's efficacy was systematically validated using a public dataset across 20, 40, and 80 MHz bandwidth configurations. The model yielded accuracies of 89.27% (20 MHz), 94.13% (40 MHz), and 95.30% (80 MHz), respectively. These results confirm a marked superiority over standalone deep learning baselines, especially in the most constrained low-bandwidth scenarios.

Nearly 40 years ago, Cederquist et al. demonstrated that asymmetric apertures enable phase retrieval (PR) algorithms to perform fully computational wavefront sensing, albeit at a high computational cost. More recently, Chimitt et al. extended this approach with machine learning and demonstrated real-time wavefront sensing using only a single (guidestar-based) point-spread-function (PSF) measurement. Inspired by these works, we introduce a guidestar-free AO framework built around asymmetric apertures and machine learning. Our approach combines three key elements: (1) an asymmetric aperture placed in the optical path that enables PR-based wavefront sensing, (2) a pair of machine learning algorithms that estimate the PSF from natural scene measurements and reconstruct phase aberrations, and (3) a spatial light modulator that performs optical correction. We experimentally validate this framework on dense natural scenes imaged through unknown obscurants. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art guidestar-free wavefront shaping methods, using an order of magnitude fewer measurements and three orders of magnitude less computation."}

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI."}

MTS performs mode-wise linear transformations with multiscale summation, enabling large receptive fields and effective modeling of cross-dimensional correlations.

However, its utility is limited by the quality of the signal. Signal-dependent speckle noise, signal-independent sensor noise, and non-uniform spatial blurring caused by the transducer and modeled by the point spread function (PSF) degrade the image quality. These degradations challenge conventional image restoration methods, which assume simplified noise models, and highlight the need for specialized algorithms capable of effectively reducing the degradations while preserving fine structural details. We propose DEMIX, a novel dual-encoder denoising framework with a masked gated fusion mechanism, for denoising ultrasound images degraded by mixed noise and further degraded by PSF-induced distortions. DEMIX is inspired by diffusion models and is characterized by a forward process and a deterministic reverse process. DEMIX adaptively assesses the different noise components, disentangles them in the latent space, and suppresses these components while compensating for PSF degradations. Extensive experiments on two ultrasound datasets, along with a downstream segmentation task, demonstrate that DEMIX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior noise suppression and preserving structural details.

Existing facial image quality assessment (FIQA) predominantly focus on either visual quality or recognition-oriented evaluation, thereby failing to jointly address visual quality and fidelity, which are critical for surveillance applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the first comprehensive study on surveillance facial image quality assessment (SFIQA), targeting the unique challenges inherent to surveillance scenarios. Specifically, we first construct SFIQA-Bench, a multi-dimensional quality assessment benchmark for surveillance facial images, which consists of 5,004 surveillance facial images captured by three widely deployed surveillance cameras in real-world scenarios. A subjective experiment is conducted to collect six dimensional quality ratings, including noise, sharpness, colorfulness, contrast, fidelity and overall quality, covering the key aspects of SFIQA.

Numerous methods have been proposed to jointly optimize key performance metrics such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and Cramér-Rao bound. However, the computational complexity of these methods often grows rapidly with the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). To tackle this challenge, we prove a fundamental structural property of the ISAC beamforming problem, i.e., there exists an optimal solution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure. This leads to an equivalent reformulation of the problem with dimension related to the number of users rather than the number of BS antennas, thereby enabling the development of low-complexity algorithms. When applying the interior-point method to the reformulated problem, we achieve up to six orders of magnitude in complexity reduction when the number of antennas exceeds the number of users by an order of magnitude. To further reduce the complexity, we develop a balanced augmented Lagrangian method to solve the reformulated problem. The proposed algorithm maintains optimality while achieving a computational complexity that scales quartically with the number of users. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed R-BAL method can achieve a speedup of more than 10000$\\times$ over the conventional IPM in massive MIMO scenarios."}

However, prevailing SSL frameworks are fundamentally \"inward-looking\", recycling information and biases solely from within the target dataset. This design triggers a vicious cycle of confirmation bias under class imbalance, leading to the catastrophic failure to recognize minority classes. To dismantle this systemic issue, we propose a paradigm shift to a multi-level \"outward-looking\" framework. Our primary innovation is Foundational Knowledge Distillation (FKD), which looks outward beyond the confines of medical imaging by introducing a pre-trained visual foundation model, DINOv3, as an unbiased external semantic teacher. Instead of trusting the student's biased high confidence, our method distills knowledge from DINOv3's robust understanding of high semantic uniqueness, providing a stable, cross-domain supervisory signal that anchors the learning of minority classes. To complement this core strategy, we further look outward within the data by proposing Progressive Imbalance-aware CutMix (PIC), which creates a dynamic curriculum that adaptively forces the model to focus on minority classes in both labeled and unlabeled subsets. This layered strategy forms our framework, DINO-Mix, which breaks the vicious cycle of bias and achieves remarkable performance on challenging semi-supervised class-imbalanced medical image segmentation benchmarks Synapse and AMOS."}

This paper addresses the fundamental question: Can arbitrary electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays achieve unambiguous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization when element spacing exceeds $λ/2$? We provide an affirmative answer by exploiting the multi-component structure of EMVS measurements and developing a synergistic estimation and optimization framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bistatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. A third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) model is constructed from EMVS observations, enabling natural separation of spatial, polarimetric, and propagation effects via the trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. A novel phase-disambiguation procedure leverages rotational invariance across the six electromagnetic components of EMVSs to resolve $2π$ phase wrapping in arbitrary array geometries, allowing unambiguous joint estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) direction of departure (DOD), two-dimensional direction of arrival (DOA), and polarization parameters with automatic pairing. To support localization in NLOS environments and enhance estimation robustness, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is incorporated and its phase shifts are optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to maximize received signal power, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and further suppressing spatial ambiguities through iterative refinement."}

We present the Local Damage Mode Extractor (LDME), a structured, physics-informed signal processing framework that combines dual-path denoising, multiscale decomposition, fractional-domain enhancement, and statistically principled anomaly scoring to produce interpretable condition indicators without supervision. LDME is organized in three layers: (i) dual-path denoising (DWT with adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing) to suppress broadband noise while preserving transient fault structure; (ii) multi-scale damage enhancement using a Teager-Kaiser pre-amplifier followed by a Hadamard-Caputo fractional operator that accentuates non-sinusoidal, low-frequency fault signatures; and (iii) decision fusion, where harmonics-aware Fourier indicators are combined and scored by an unsupervised anomaly detector. Evaluation using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, the HUMS 2023 planetary gearbox benchmark, and a controlled simulated dataset shows that LDME consistently distinguishes nominal, early-crack, and propagated-crack stages under various operating conditions. LDME identifies the primary detection event earlier (198 cycles) than HT-TSA (284 cycles) and advances maintenance recommendation time from 383 to 365 cycles.

We propose MS-Flow, which represents the trajectory as a sequence of intermediate latent states rather than a single initial code. By enforcing the flow dynamics locally and coupling segments through trajectory-matching penalties, MS-Flow alternates between updating intermediate latent states and enforcing consistency with observed data. This reduces memory consumption while improving reconstruction quality.

Conventional end-to-end algorithms couple CKM prior information with task- and device-specific observations, and require labeled data and separate training for each construction configuration, which is expensive and therefore incompatible with scalable edge deployments. Motivated by the trends toward cloud-edge collaboration and the Artificial Intelligence - Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) paradigm, we develop a cloud-edge collaborative framework for scalable CKM construction, which enables knowledge sharing across tasks, devices, and regions by explicitly decoupling a generalizable CKM prior from the information provided by local observations. A foundation model is trained once in the cloud using unlabeled data to learn a generalizable CKM prior. During inference, edge nodes combine the shared prior with local observations.

The objective function consists of a combination of smoothness measures across all considered simplicial levels, allowing for the incorporation of arbitrary smoothness criteria. This formulation enables the simultaneous estimation of edges and higher-order simplices within a single optimization problem.

In contrast to prior studies that assume a fixed SF channel, we note that the SF channel is configurable, as its characteristics are shaped by various transmission and reception strategies, such as power allocation. Based on this observation, we formulate the SF channel optimization problem under a mutual information constraint between the SFs and their reconstructions, and analytically derive the optimal SF channel under a linear encoder-decoder structure and Gaussian source assumption. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a joint optimization framework for the encoder-decoder and SF channel, applicable to both analog and digital SCs.

In this work, we propose augmenting the upper confidence bound (UCB) based MAB with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to address this limitation. The premise of the work is that the radar and communication functionalities share the same field-of-view and that communication mobile users are detected by the radar as mobile targets. The radar information is used for significantly reducing the number of candidate beams for the UCB, resulting in an overall reduction in the exploration time. Further, the radar information is used to estimate the realignment time in quasi-stationary scenarios. We have realized the MAB and radar signal processing algorithms on the system on chip (SoC) via hardware-software co-design (HSCD) and fixed-point analysis. We demonstrate the significant gain in execution time using accelerators. The simulations consider complex propagation channels involving direct and multipath, with simple and extended radar targets in the presence of significant static clutter.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications."}

Radar rapidly detects and localizes mobile users (MUs), after which communication proceeds through narrow beams identified by radar. Achieving fine Doppler resolution for MU clutter discrimination requires long coherent processing intervals, reducing communication time and throughput. To address this, we propose a reconfigurable architecture for Doppler estimation realized on a system on chip using hardware software codesign. The architecture supports algorithm level reconfiguration, dynamically switching between low-complexity, high-speed FFT-based coarse estimation and high complexity ESPRIT based fine estimation. We introduce modifications to ESPRIT that achieve 6.7 times faster execution while reducing memory and multiplier usage by 79% and 63%, respectively, compared to state of the art approaches, without compromising accuracy. Additionally, the reconfigurable architecture can switch to lower slow time packets under high SNR conditions, improving latency further by 2 times with no loss in performance."}

In order to study the maximum data rate that is feasible in such kind of OCC systems, this paper presents its equivalent digital communication system model in which the rolling-shutter camera is modeled as a rectangular matched-filter whose time width is equal to the exposure time of the camera, followed by a sampling process at the pixel row sweep rate of the camera. Based on the proposed rolling-shutter camera model, the maximum symbol rate that such OCC systems can support is experimentally demonstrated, and the impact of imperfect time synchronization between the VLC transmitter and the rolling-shutter OCC receiver is characterized in the form of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). The equivalent three-tap channel model that results from this process is experimentally validated and the generated ISI is compensated with the use of linear equalization in reception. Simulation and experimental results show a strong correlation between them, demonstrating that the proposed approach can be used to make the OCC system work at the Nyquist sampling rate, which is equivalent to the pixel row sweep rate of the rolling-shutter camera used in reception."}

Here, radar and communication functionalities share a common spectrum and hardware resources in a time-multiplexed manner. The objective of the radar is to first scan the angular search space and detect and localize mobile users/targets in the presence of discrete clutter scatterers. Subsequently, this information is used to direct highly directional beams toward these mobile users for communication service. The choice of radar parameters such as the radar duty cycle and the corresponding beamwidth are critical for realizing high communication throughput. In this work, we use the stochastic geometry-based mathematical framework to analyze the radar operating metrics as a function of diverse radar, target, and clutter parameters and subsequently use these results to study the network throughput of the ISAC system. The results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations."}

The dynamical process is model-free, that is, we do not have any knowledge of the nonlinear dynamics of the complex process. There is no state-transition model (STM) of the process available. The proposed DNS uses a recurrent architecture that helps to provide a closed-form posterior of the hidden state sequence given the measurement sequence. DNS learns in an unsupervised manner, meaning the training dataset consists of only measurement data and no state data. We demonstrate DNS using simulations for smoothing of several stochastic dynamical processes, including a benchmark Lorenz system. Experimental results show that the DNS is significantly better than a deep Kalman smoother (DKS) and an iterative data-driven nonlinear state estimation (iDANSE) smoother."}

Here, a passive radar receiver is deployed to detect uncooperative targets on Earth's surface by capturing ground-reflected satellite signals. This work demonstrates a hardware prototype of an L-band Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) satellite-based remote sensing receiver system mounted on an AMD Zynq radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) platform. Two synchronized receiver channels are introduced for capturing the direct signal (DS) from the satellite and ground-reflected signal (GRS) returns from targets. These signals are processed on the ARM processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA) of the RFSoC to generate delay-Doppler maps of the ground-based targets. The performance is first validated in a loop-back configuration of the RFSoC. Next, the DS and GRS signals are emulated by the output from two ports of the Keysight Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and interfaced with the RFSoC where the signals are subsequently processed to obtain the delay-Doppler maps. The performance is validated for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)."}

In this paper, we analyze the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for near-field localization and sensing operated with large antenna arrays, which offers a tighter characterization of estimation accuracy compared to traditional bounds such as the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB), especially in low signal-to-noise ratio or threshold regions. Leveraging spherical wavefront and array geometry in the signal model, we evaluate the ZZB for distance and angle estimation, investigating the dependence of the accuracy on key signal and system parameters such as array geometry, wavelength, and target position. Our analysis highlights the transition behavior of the ZZB and underscores the fundamental limitations and opportunities for accurate near-field sensing."}

Nevertheless, SemComs rely heavily on the utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) at the transceivers, which limit the accuracy between the original and reconstructed data and are challenging to implement in practice due to increased architecture complexity. Thus, hybrid cellular networks that utilize both conventional bit communications (BitComs) and SemComs have been introduced to bridge the gap between required and existing infrastructure. To facilitate such networks, in this work, we investigate reliability by deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the network. Additionally, we propose a generalized outage probability through which the cell radius that achieves a desired outage threshold for a specific range of users is calculated in closed form. Additionally, to consider the practical limitations caused by the specialized dedicated hardware and the increased memory and computational resources that are required to support SemCom, a semantic utilization metric is proposed. Based on this metric, we express the probability that a specific number of users select SemCom transmission and calculate the optimal cell radius for that number in closed form. Simulation results validate the derived analytical expressions and the characterized design properties of the cell radius found through the proposed metrics, providing useful insights."}

At the receiver, we design a parallel flow-matching (PFM) decoder that leverages flow-based generative priors to jointly estimate the channel and the source, yielding much more efficient inference than the existing diffusion-based approaches. To benchmark performance limits, we derive the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) for the joint channel and source estimation problem. Extensive simulations over block-fading MIMO-OFDM channels demonstrate that the proposed DU-PFM approach drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both channel estimation accuracy and source reconstruction quality."}

However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions."}
