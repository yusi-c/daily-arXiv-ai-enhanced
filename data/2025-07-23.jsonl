However, compared to features in conventional\nphotographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due\nto the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These\nchallenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of\nannotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning\nmodel performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we\nexamined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for\nnatural images.\n  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,\nsemantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable\ncues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement\ncannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which\ncan be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we\nintroduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation\naccuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we\nfound that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,\nwhich is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset\nused in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only\nachieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers."}

However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic\nsegmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data,\nvisually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle\nthese challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning\narchitecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change\ndetection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net\nbackbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively\nutilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN\nutilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between\nphysical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ\nenvironmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN\ndemonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models,\nparticularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN\nachieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models\nin predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges\nseveral key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis,\nadvancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental\nsettings."}
